Mailed From: Ahweiler, Germany on April 3, 1919
&lt;p&gt;Ahweiler, Germany
April 3, 1919
Dear Lorin, Grace, and Audrey
just few lines tonight while have an opportunity to write. This will be last letter I'll write in Germany. Post office closes in Morning. Haven't received any mail from you all since last writing. Hear from Papa every time mail comes in. Won't get anymore mail on this side of water. Division headquarters leaves here for Brest on the 5th. The Signal Battalion leaves here 3:50 am the 10th. Probably arrive Brest the 13th or 14th and embark about the 16th or 17th. Will be in states by time this letter reaches you. At present I'm billed to be demobilized in Texas. That's because I enlisted there but I'm pretty sure I can have it changed to Camp Taylor, Kentucky because it would cost the government less to send me to Taylor than it would to Texas. The majority of the Signal Battalion will be mustered out in Camp Taylor. I worn have vert far to go from there to see you all. Golly, but I'm certainly tickled we are going.
There will be 23 trains more theDivision to Brest. 24 american box cars to a train and 45 men to a car. They figure on making the trip to Brest in 60 hours. We leave on the 20th train. Had physical examination yesterday. I passed ok but there were quite a few who didnt pass, due to their own misconduct. They were sent to hospital and Lord only knows when they'll get home. I'd certainly hate to be in their shoes.
Having hie weather now but had quite a spell of rotten weather lately.
We'll I'll have to stop. Sure hope I get to come to Taylor to be discharged. Will wire you when I arrive in States but don't be surprised if the telegram comes collect -Ha.
Well hope you are all well. Will see you soon.
Lots Love
