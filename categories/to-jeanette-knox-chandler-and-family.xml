&lt;p&gt;Pearl May 8, 1886
Dear Nettie, Annie and Family,
Your letter of the 5th received and was glad to hear from you to know of you being all well as this leaves us. I see by your letter and also from Willie's that you are having lots of rain. We are having fine weather here now, not one day since Easter to present plowing or work of dig kind. We had two heavy rains but both came in the night so it did not stop work in the least. Some farmers are done planting. Most about 1/2 done - the corn is coming up fine that is planted and what is looking fine, filled knee height, and fine looking. Fruit is promising all. Only peaches, which are winter killed. Gardens and garden truck look fine. We are having plenty of lettuce and onions coming in now and has been for 8 to 10 days ago. Some growing potatoes look fine 3 to 4 inches high. I do not think that I ever saw such grass or foliage on the trees at this time of year before. We are having delightful weather, as fine as you could wish and even better. The river is falling fast, the water will soon be off the low bottom. Some are now commencing to fill up the bottom, and think they are going to make good crops yet. I have not saw Smith or any of them since I wrote you I learn he is coping in the bottom. As usual he sent me word lately to get him if I could. A bush of broom corn left but I could not get it and sent him word. Lizzie Johnson is still here. Your Ma, Maggie, and her has lots to do. They have a girl called Kate Meginis now for a week helping while they are cleaning house. She is not an expert but does the best she can. Johnie is working on the section with Honan and doing very well. Horan think there never was such a fellow as he is. Still he has to work as other do. I had a letter from Willie same day I got yours. He gave me a full detail of your parties, said he was expecting you over Friday, to stay a day or two. Your Ma is at a loss to know why. You folks are not ready, or could say when you can start or intend to, of course I hate to say any word about your coming. Least Annie does not want too (or cannot make it commence to do so, without great inconvenience.) Hence I am loathe to insist, but it seems to me that the folks, their ought to be getting tired of your lengthy visit. It seems to me that I would not make the folks twice glad, once to see you come and once to see you leave. I do not know that this is the case, but it seems to me you ought to ask sometime.
May 10 I will finish
I went yesterday with Lew Shoustien to visit his folks at Belleview, has a nice time and a pleasant drive, and found Lewis pretty well fixed at home. Has nice property if he had it somewhere to be profitable, but it is like property in Monteguma or Florence , the day has past for such places. I have just got my commission from the governor for Police Magistrate, again, as I was reelected on last election after a big fight - made here by some miracle. Your Ma, Maggie, and Lizzie is having lots to do the last week or so. They have been cleaning house. They had for the last 2 weeks a girl named Kate Meginis helping. She has not much get up about her. We have the house pretty well filled but they keep coming and going, some 5 left today, but there may be 5 or 6 more wanting their place, in a day or two. You must say to Lucy that George is keeping his pants buttoned up and his face washed every day. Our short legged boy is still training so J.W. has better look a little better if he earns that candy.
Yours,
D.Knox&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in letter:
Dear Annie, G.R., and children,
I drop this note there by Nettie's letter. I started to write you folks Saturday but failed to finish. I am not doing much but I am called away by someone every two or three minutes. I write this to say that we are somewhat disappointed and sorry that you seem to be so preoccupied with work so it is somewhat uncertain where you can make a start. Don't think that we are mad or offended at you, we do not want you to do anything to discontent yourself, or that would be a hardship to you, or any of you, of course we would like to see you all and all. But if there is conflicting elements in the way, so as to be a hardship to you we cannot insist, but if you cannot come I think it would be better for Nettie to come as her  lengthy visit must be getting tiresome to you folks. Besides her Ma could find lots for her to do if at home that would be a great help to het as she is pretty well worn out, we had no idea that she would have stayed over half the time she has stayed. But we are all satisfied, supposing you were going to come with her. We are having very fine weather and all things looking fine. We are having lots of garden vegetables such as onions and lettuce, for some 8 or 10 despots. No late word from Izora or folks. All were all at last report. The water is going down nicely, likely will give no more trouble. Tell Bop. that Nettie and Lucy must give him more room, for his back and tell him to grow big so as to whip this boys here when he does come. Of course Lucy is now quite a little lady, so I am fixing up a nice little handkerchief for her when she comes.
Give my best respects to all and believe that I am as ever your Pa
David Knox
Write soon
Smith was here today. All well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in letter:
For Lucy and Johnie -
Dear children,
As I did not get Nettie's letter ready tamale yesterday. I will write you a little letter of your own. I will say to you if your Ma do not bring you down here pretty soon, I will send you a ticket so you can come yourself. Be sure you give your Ma no peace till she comes, I am afraid that Lucy will be so big that she will not know her Grand-Pa and the probability is I might not know you and I doubt whether I would know J.W. at all. Still I kind of think I would know you both. At any rate, I do not want you to be much longer coming least you all get out of my knowledges. Oh, Johnie you ought to see a nice little colt I have got for you to ride when you come, and you can loan it to Sister Lucy to ride once in a while. I know Lucy can borrow her Aunt Maggie's saddle, then she can ride about with George of course, Johnie will be boss of the colt, so Lucy will have to talk up her claim to J.W. but I think we can arrange it when you come. You will need a riding whip too. You may bet we will have a good time. You must write me what you think about it so I will have all fixed up when you get here. Love to you from your Grand-Pa.

Dear Sister and family,
I have since you were here, been making inquiry whenever I could in regard to the "Annex" to the State Hospital. These buildings are for Vocational training of patients that can be trusted or handled outside of the main building. This state and Hospital has gained world wide reputation since taking up this line of training of inmates and has recently attracted leading physicians of other state institutions there to learn the details of this work. The idea is this: to give those that can be trusted the best of environments afforded with something to keep their minds and body employed and with the training and treatment, many of them will soon recover. Dr. Chapin was here yesterday. He speaks very highly of Dr. Hill, and of being a gentleman of the highest type, but his letter to you was a mistaken identity - or he was badly off. I want to go to the Hospital and meet Dr. Hill and would like D. C. or some other physician of acquaintance to go with me.
I believe the Annex is the best for Annie, she has heard of the Annex, and formed a wrong conception of its purposes. Perhaps though after patients that did not know any more of it than she didd and had become biased against it by name, without knowing its real purpose. Mr. and Mrs. Fox, Edith &amp;amp; Mildred drove to Pittsfield Friday, stopped at Milton for minutes. Mr. Fox has business that took him there.
Lucile is home, expect to remain for another week or possibly longer. I am expecting to go to J-Ville soon and will if I have the time to visit the Hospt, but doubt  that invite. I expect to take a patient to Dr. Morbury and other doctors for examination and may be crowded for time at the visit. What has become of John? I used to hear from him once and a while, not for a long time now.
Your Bro,

&lt;p&gt;White Hall, Oct. 2, 1919
Dear Sister and Family,
Your letter received. It was a very pretty wedding, pronounced the prettiest. Belle was quite sick yesterday, is still sick but decidedly better. Is up and down now, supper time. She has been on a strain for two or three weeks but as you say, she is near her month and sister which means much of us. I have started papers to Anna, Ruby, &amp;amp; Grace. We were much disappointed that Bess did not come and have wondered what prevented her from coming. The girl's associate friends of Lucile gave her several social gatherings and in each was nicely remembered. At last meeting for her at the Star, she was surprised with a beautiful Seth Thomas Mantel clock. A package came today from Princeton, Ill. a former M.H. Girl's Associate.
Annie's improvement will be great compared with her condition at home, but her completely recovery is very doubtful. I don't believe those in charge would cause her to work, it is possible, they may require her to look after her room, but they sure would not take her to any church, not of her choice, she would have the privilege of choosing her church. I don't know whether or not, there is a chapel of the Institution. If so, it would be open to all denominations. I don't believe there is. I am sorry indeed that John &amp;amp; family have had much to say concerning Annie's affliction. In my last letter to John, I told him that it appeared to me that they were looking out for little things - and when they seemingly appeared looked like mountains to them that can be the trouble any how? I told him I expected him &amp;amp; Bertha with us the day we were there, but learned that they were there after our leave and I wondered if it was our presence that kept them from coming? I have not heard from hims since, I told him with only 4 of the family left, we ought to get along in peace and not be continuously suspicious of the other. Lucile and husband are in Davenport and Rock Island this week, arrived there Friday eve. Her Aunt Metta Chapin-Green is or has been living in Rock Island and are moving to Davenport. Green has been best cashier of the Rock Island Savings Bank until October and was chosen for Cashier of the 1st National Bank of Davenport and they are moving this week to Davenport. Also in Davenport, Lois Maine-Rilling, Lucile's companion in school in Manchester, started together and graduated together, her husband is a preacher, pastor of Presbyterian Church. Strange coincidence that both should marry preachers. They go to his father's home at Cerro Gonda tomorrow, the 3rd and from there they go to Sadorus, his appointment - for next Sunday. They will return here next week.
They took the midnight last Wednesday night for Chicago, selected furniture there through Mr. Fox. Today is the 1st day of the Annual Corn Carnival at Milton, would like to have gone for part of one day, one would meet many old time friends that it would be a pleasure to see and get new acquaintances.
Dr. Vinnie insisted that we come, Dr. thought I could not afford to miss that, but I miss many things.
Friday - I failed to have this ready for mail before time passed, here's a day late. Belle about same as yesterday, very week from attack of Thursday - is up and down  - mostly down - the sugar proportion serious. No sugar in market and fruit going to waste. The US Senate should have quit playing politics two months or more ago and done business for the people, in ratifying the Treaty League and the settlement of International Affairs. Read the article, "The Shantey Problem" in paper sent yon by Danskin - a Rep - it covers the Senatorial dissatisfaction entirely. While writing these lines Dr. McDouglas, wife, niece Bess D, and husband just called, on their way to Milton. On the road met with a man who throwned them to top of car, and make a cut over my Dr. eye and they stopped for me to attend it. Dr. Will and I were in Sidney, Iowa together and great friends. It has been a long time since I have seen him, saw her this summer. She was attending a church missionary meeting in this County of District and called on one when going through. Both he and her received quite a jolt, he was knocked unconscious for a few moments, her cut caused bleeding freely and dress sprinkled. She is joyful, happy being, even with disfigured eye, black at that, and will show more black today.

&lt;p&gt;Christmas Eve, 1918
Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Good chance to write few lines this pm so thought I'd do it. Nothing new to speak of. Understand we will leave here tomorrow or next day but don't know where we're going. Wish we were homeward bound. Just one year ago today (3 pm) we were clearing the docks at New York on the Steamship, Lapland. It was an English passenger liner but carried troops during the war. I had a dandy room during the voyage. Landed in Liverpool Jan 7th and went to Winchester, England. Was there for 5 days. I contracted the measles there and went to the hospital upon arrival at Le Havre. That's last I saw of the 1st F.B.S.C. Now I don't know whether or not I'll ever see the 117th F.B.S.C. anymore or not. Golly I'd certainly love to have my mail and know how you all are.
I wrote the girls at Wichita on the 21st and Grace the 22nd. Today is pretty day. First clear day we've had for several weeks. I was up yesterday over the ground which we captured during the St. Michael drive. It's only a short distance from here. 10 miles. Went to the place where we kicked off at 5 am the morning we drove. It has been cleared up since the battle. Shell holes had been filled up and debris cleared away. Saw the graves of some of my friends. There were six of us made the trip. Two of them had been wounded during that battle and went to the exact spot where they had been hit. Got back here last night in time for supper. Sure was tired. It was during that drive that Elmer Dooey was killed. Didn't knew he was from Pittsfield until I saw his name in Casualty list.
Well don't know any more to write. Hope I'm home for next Christmas.

Dearest Folks,
Guess you think its about time some of us were writing but I have been so busy since I came home. I've hardly had time. The dust was force all over the house and it took some cleaning, then the washing and ironing had to be done and I have also canned a bushel of tomatoes so you can see it would keep me pretty busy.
Guess you are all lonesome since we've all left or maybe it will be a rest?
We arrived home about 9p.m., got off at Berdan and hired an auto to take us to Greenfield where we met Mr. Stocks and came on home with him.
Mother and Father had just gotten home the same evening from Kansas.
Have opened some of the jam you sent and it was surely fine. The canned Blackberries are the prettiest I ever saw. Will just have to thank you until you are better paid.
Did Bess go with Mae to Wichita as she expected to?
Will try to write sooner the next time. Hope you are all well. Had a nice time while at home. Much love to all.
Lovingly,

Dearest Mama, Papa, and all
I've just gotten cleaned up and thought I had better write. We had intended to go to Taylorville to a football game but something was the matter with the car. I did want to go so bad, but I'm going to Jane Carrie's house to see about a party the Glee Club is to give Thursday night.
I got along all OK with my recitation. I've had so many compliments on it. Nearly every time I'd see anyone who was there, they'd tell me how well I did.
You know I told you that some Taylorville Ladies came down and organized a Hilson Ladie's Club. Well Mrs. Pence was appointed as a committee of one to arrange for a Glee Club. She asked me and six other girls and we sang here, at Harvel, and at Taylorville. Our songs were real cute. We had one to the tun of My Little Girl - Oh Mr. Hughes you're stock are dropping
You are losing notes each day
Oh Mr. Hughes we hear you're knocking
Tho you're many miles away
We read your talks in all the papers
What you've promised not to do
Oh Mr. Hughes we know you're lonely
But we can not note for you
We had lots of other ones too and some Wilson yells. While we were at marvel a man gave us five dollars, so were going to have a party on it. We get to invite "our company" - Don't know who to invite. The ladies of Tayloville treated us so nice and altogether we've had lots of fun. We'll know Tuesday who is to be our president.
I got my coat while I was at Taylorville. It's brown velour. I did want a plush with brown fur trimming but they were too expensive.
Hope I get to come home Thanksgiving but guess I wont if I don't get a pass because my fare would be nearly six dollars. I'll sure be home Xmas tho' and get to stay from Dec 22 to Jan.
Hope you are all well - I'm getting along fine at school. We had a program in my room day before yesterday. It was real good. The girls asked me to sin so I sang Little Gray Home in the West. We had company, too.
Lorin has just offered Grace and I $0.15 each if we read something against Wilson in the Republican news paper. You couldn't pick up a republican news paper without reading something against Wilson. In fact that's about all it contains.
I'm enclosing a five with which I want to pay my lodge dues for the past four or five months. Guess it wont come amiss if everything is as high as it is here. Flour is $3.00 a sack. You never did say whether or not you got the other $5.00 (which I borrowed to buy shoes in Springfield) I returned but I guess you did because you got the letter. I've got all of my debts paid now, Pearl Store, my board, Donohoo's, Ruby, and you. I wrote to Mrs. Moultrie too - All I owe, now is a letter to Ruby and I'll try to write it soon. Martin never did answer my letter. When you write tell him I'm looking for one. Lot's of Love,
Bess&lt;/p&gt;

Dearest Net and all,
Just a few to let you know that Grandpa is better this morning. He can't use his left hand at all. Just from his wrist. Grandma is feeling about the same. Her back and side hurts quite a bit. She wants you to send her winter underclothes and Grandpa too. We got a card from Ray on Tuesday and it was mailed at Spokane Washington. Looking for a card today. I had the paper hanger and painter yesterday. Haven't got everything back in place yet. Was up and help Aunt clean up for she has so much to do. Bill sat up until midnight so did Sapp and Gladys. Grandpa's bowels was so loose. Sapp got a bottle of Blackberry Brandy and it is helping him.
I bet Leta is happy. If you see give her my best wishes.
This will be all for today.
Love to all,

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received Mama's nice long letter today and the "Tribune" and "Times" from Bess and sure glad to get them. It's the first I've received for a week. Haven't heard from Papa for about a week. Generally hear from Papa every 2 or 3 days. Not much news to write. Received letter from Ruth Powers yesterday. She is going to Fairmount College this winter. Surprised to hear Carrie Wild was married. I received 2 or 3 letters from her while in Montana but she didn't say anything about being engaged. Got my pay check yesterday. $49.00. Board was 27 and O.R. 2 $6.00 and paid $5.00 on my suit. Got $3.50 left. I'm going to send for Tribune tonight so can get it every week. It's getting a little colder here all the time. Have to have a fire every night. Think I'll be here until first of September. Bulletin was up on this place yesterday but don't think they will fill it until 1st of month. Sure hope they don't strike cause that would throw us out of a job. I don't think they will strike though. I went to Atascadero yesterday pm with another man and his wife in a car. It's a settlement just sprung up lately. Yet it sure is a pretty place. More like a park than anything else. All kinds flowers. We have lots of fruit of every description here. I'm so tired of it can hardly look at it anymore. Here Knox sure pulled off a heroic stunt when he saved the little girls fishing pole. Ha- wish I could see you all. I was so homesick last night didn't know what to do. I'd just love to see that Illinois river.
Must stop and go to work.
Write Often

Dear Nettie, Annie, and children
I received a short note from Nettie yesterday eve. Was glad to find by it that you were all well as this leaves us all at present. Altho the folks are somewhat disappointed. Nettie wrote a letter to Willie which were received same eve he left. Thot you folks were going to be here, but he had already gone before your letter got here. Still they expected you all the same as you never contradicted your statement to him. I came nigh down to White Hall on Wednesday eve. When you did not get here on the noon train thinking you would be like on the 12 o'clock at night but did not go but concluded to staying up here until the 12 o'clock train would come but still you did not. Just in appearance I hope all is for the best. I got a letter from Willie dated 29, that was the first I've had from you to know what you had done. He said you were undecided whether you would come till after the 4, but thought you would come with Quincy the same you went, and thought he probably would come see you right now and though he probably might come too, but today I received a letter from him from Dosmoine's, of date July 1st. He was sent there as a assistant to some delegate to the state convention. He says he has met several acquaintances . Speaks of a Dr. Clark who resides there formerly of Freemount. Speaks of a J. M. Hammond showing him great favour. He says yes and Annie will think he has forgotten you as he promised to look up the best route for you to come. I sent him a letter to Sidney yesterday thinking he was as likely to get it there as any where. As he told me that he and Hatten had played out. He told me that he would quit before he left he thought we or they are making large preparations here for tomorrow. It is said there will be a very large crowd here they are coming from Manchester Roadhouse, Whitehall Strout, Neb., and nigh all of Milton is expected . They are fixing up pretty nice for Pearl.
There is no use bothering you with a lengthy letter as I suppose you will soon all be here. Hoping to see you all soon. I am as every your Pa.
Love to all,
DKnox&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you see Willie tell him I will not write him til I hear from him again.
