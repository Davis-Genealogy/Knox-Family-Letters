Dearest Folks,
Enclosing another of Mama's letters. Didn't you tell Rollin to forward your mail? I thought you told Aunt Bertha to tell him. Started to make my red silk pillow yesterday. It will be awfully pretty.   Lorin made a deal yesterday whereby I get my bedroom papers. Picked the paper this a.m. Bid design with orange, lavender, and green leaves and flowers. And it sure will be cheerful looking. Will be not tomorrow. Then will have all the floors repainted by the same fellow. 3 coats and Lorin told him this morning to polychrome my big mirror. So were just coming along fine. Annette started back to school this morning after missing 4 days. But she sure looks frail and pale. Big snow Sunday night. First big snow we've had. Must get my ironing started. How you are all well and enjoying life.
Lovingly,
Grace&lt;/p&gt;

Dearest Folks,
Guess you think its about time some of us were writing but I have been so busy since I came home. I've hardly had time. The dust was force all over the house and it took some cleaning, then the washing and ironing had to be done and I have also canned a bushel of tomatoes so you can see it would keep me pretty busy.
Guess you are all lonesome since we've all left or maybe it will be a rest?
We arrived home about 9p.m., got off at Berdan and hired an auto to take us to Greenfield where we met Mr. Stocks and came on home with him.
Mother and Father had just gotten home the same evening from Kansas.
Have opened some of the jam you sent and it was surely fine. The canned Blackberries are the prettiest I ever saw. Will just have to thank you until you are better paid.
Did Bess go with Mae to Wichita as she expected to?
Will try to write sooner the next time. Hope you are all well. Had a nice time while at home. Much love to all.
Lovingly,

&lt;p&gt;From: Grace Chandler, To: Chandler Family&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday 8th '17
Dearest Folks
Will try to write you a few lines this am. Was so glad to hear from Mama yesterday. Doesn't matter to whom they are addressed, just so I get them.
Am feeling much better, one breast is still swelled, and I have the night sweats and a breaking out on my body caused from fever, But I am getting stronger every day now. Mrs. Kelley left Saturday P.M. and I bathed the baby yesterday and this morning. She is doing fine and everyone was out yesterday afternoon, then Mr. and Mrs. Geo Maxon and son wee out last night. Guess we'll keep having company, as so many have told Lorin they're so anxious to see the baby. He's going to try and get some pictures of her this noon.
Thanks to Grandma Chandler, she has another silver dollar to add to her savings. Don't think she should have done it, but we appreciate it. Lorin took her little bank up to the bank this A.M. He adds something every day I think. Mrs. Klingner and Mella were out after you left Mama and brought her a little solid gold hand ring.
The material Ruby has for her coat is so pretty and I'm sure proud of it.
Guess you'd be surprised, as we were shocked to hear Mr. Bartlett the Wabash agent here, committed suicide in the depot on Friday. No reason has been assigned to his rash act, but an auditor came in to check him up and a dray man testified at the coroners inquest that he had heard them arguing over some freight bills. Some additions that had been added to Paddock Lumber Co.'s bills. But other people think it was family affairs. Will send you the clippings from the papers if I can find them. He was the agent here for 7 years. It certainly was a shock to everyone as they were supposed to have been the happiest of families.
Am so glad to have Ruby here. She is so good to me, but I'll tell you I missed Mama and so did Mrs. Kelley. She spoke of you so often. Bess was so sleepy after talking all night that she layer down and slept in the afternoon and I had a lump in my throat all day. Ruby had spells over the "offspring" when she arrived and has never quite gotten over her yet. Wish everyone of you could see her.
Lorin is going to be in a minstrel show tomorrow night in Taylorville , some fellows pulled out at the last minute and they asked Lorin to take one place. He's to be an end man and has a prominent part. He's studying his song "Are you from Dixie" and his gags. Either Bess or Ruby will go to Taylorville and see it.
Wonder what causes Mama to get so dizzy? Mrs. Kelley had those kind of spells.
Yes, we let Mrs. Wilson know you had gone. She was called to St. Louis on Friday to take care of her niece, a trained nurse, who has pneumonia and expects will be gone for some time.
Mrs. Peuce (your advisor Mama) is also very ill with pneumonia. They have a trained nurse to care for her. Other box from fathers came after such a time. He sent the baby a powder puff, me a small picture of mother and a baby, a towel, and a box of stationary, and a lot of Christmas candy. Was nice of him to remember us. He sent each member of his family something. We heard from mother , three miners and she have taken more cold and was having lots to do.
Bess and Lorin went to Bartlett's funeral. It as held at the house hey said. There were oceans of flowers.
Will be glad to get Lucerne's drawings . Was so sorry to her Mary school her, but its all over now and it didn't hurt anyway did it Lucerne?
When little Jack was here, he went over to Waggners and told them we had a dog. They said "what kind of dog is it?" he said he didn't know. They asked if it was a bird do. He said, "No! This dog don't fly!" Ha.
Mrs. Waggner and Gladys came over the next day after you left. We have had lots of company.
Lorin just called up from town and said I had letters from home, but he had to go to Taylorvillle and won't be back until night. Said he'd send the letters down to the school house to Bess and I'll get them about 4 pm. I want to send this up by Bess this noon so I'll close for this time as she's ready to do back.
Love to Everybody,

Dearest Papa, Mama, &amp;amp; all: -
Guess you think it's about time I was writing - Bess and I just got back from Sunday School. We took a spurt this am and got ready and went to the Presbyterian SS and everyone treated us so nice we are glad we went. bess is correcting some papers and making out some examination papers and I have dinner on cooking. Did think I would come in and play the graphonolia but thot I would be making better use of my time if I write home.
Ruby left yesterday morning and we sure miss her. Bess and i took her to the train, had to get up at 6 am so we could have breakfast and get to the depot by 6:58 am.
Bess and i then came home, cleaned the house real good and she had to go to a teachers reading circle at 2 pm. I dusted and scrubbed after she left took a bath and dressed up again and went to meet her. Got there in time to hear part of the work. We walked up town again went to Callie's and she insisted on us staying and having supper. So Lorin came in on the 6:30 pm train and we went to meet him and all took supper there. Then went to the picture show. Lorin bought me the most beautiful purple velvet tricornered hat for my birthday, he said, but that isn't until the 6th of next month. So he was in plenty of time - Ha. My white coat just got back this am from the cleaners, so you make know I wore my new hat and white coat to S.S. and felt quite dressed up. Bess cleaned her lack suit yesterday and wore my other purple hat.
Our electric washer came yesterday pm and Lorin got up early this morning and had it in working order by the time we got up. It sure us a peach and I'm tickled we have it - will sure save my back.
Lorin is going to Taylorville to get out car today, had to leave it up there the last time he was up there, on account of some man running into him and busting it up some. Will cost about $30 to get it fixed up again. Lorin sued him for $200 - the trail comes up next week. Hope he gets what it will cost us. The car is alright now so he is going to get it today.
I am cooking apples whole not peeled, with such red skin, also sweet potatoes, kraut pork &amp;amp; wieners. Have raw tomatoes with mayonnaise dressing for dinner.
How is papa? You said he was not feeling well when you last wrote. Hope is better by now. Guess Margaret &amp;amp; Lucerne will have a great time in St. Louis. Lorin said I could go, but I don't believe I want to. It would be different if he and Bess could both go.
I was surprised Leta &amp;amp; John stayed in Pearl to spend their honeymoon. Guess they have gone to St. Louis by now.
Mon. P.M. Guess I'll finish this and get it mailed. After dinner yesterday we drove to Taylorville with Oren Bloxom and another fellow, attended a football game, and drove our own car back home. Oren Bloxom came back with us - He's a Taylorville boy, and is going to be a lawyer. Bess entertained him until his train time. I was so tired, Lorin and I went to bed. I had lunch for all.
Lorin forwarded two letters to Ruby this a.m. I told him to send them to Pearl I was afraid she wouldn't get them if we sent them to Granite City.
I pulled the pears, Ruby will be glad to know and have just finished two gallons of pear butter. I had them on hand for over two weeks, so you may be sure I'm glad they're cooked up.
Lorin is going to put up the base burner this afternoon. It isn't very cold yet but he thought he'd better put it up while he had time.
Bess said at noon that she must write home. I told her I had a letter started.
She has four sets of papers to correct this evening after she comes home. She'll be pretty busy this week with giving examinations and correcting papers.
I wish papa could come up if only for a few days, might do him good and we would be tickled to death to have him. Some of you could get a pass and come up anytime. Well this is all I can think of for now. Lorin will be down around that part of the country next week, I suppose.
Write when you can, we're always ticked to hear from home.
Much love to all,
Lovingly,
Grace
Tues. A.M. -
Am sure going to get this mailed this morning. We have a train out of here for St. Louis at 3:37 P.M. and Lorin was just saying at the breakfast table that we could go down and see the Veiled Prophet tonight and get home on the midnight train if Bess could get her Supt. to teach for her half hour. So no telling we may be there tonight ourselves. The matter is to be settled at noon after Bess talks with the Supt. and Lorin is to study it over.

Dearest Mamma,
Doesn't see possible that we are in the beautiful city of Omaha and have come across the state of Iowa. Sarchett is coming to Dunlap tomorrow.

How are you? And do you miss us? We're having the best time. Our trunk just came this morning and we were mighty glad to get it too.

&lt;p&gt;Dear Papa,
We went up town for the first time tonight. This is such a pretty place! Aunt Annie has such a mice home. We're going out to John's tomorrow. Aunt Annie and Uncle Leo are going too. Will write soon.
Lovingly,

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Martin Chandler

&lt;p&gt;Dear Bro
Received your letter this a.m. and you can be sure we were more than glad to get it. Everyone, Mae, Vinnie, and all just go on about your writing, so you want to write more often and give them a letter sample.
Ruby, Vinnie, and I went to a big ball game yesterday. Wichita and Omaha. 6 to 4 in favor of Omaha. The ninth inning was a tie 4 to 4 and they played 12. We certainly enjoyed Madame X because we had never seen anything like it before. However, it was all in French and you know we know very little French. They paid $4.00 for our seats. What do you know about it? Mr. A. Jones and another friend of his are going to take us out rowing on the Arkansas river Monday and we have all kids of things to do the next week. We had our pictures taken and will send you some shortly. We were over to a neighbors house and sang last night. Mrs. Johnston will start home about next Tuesday.
With Love,
Grace&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>From: Grace Chandler</category><category>Postcard</category><category>To: Martin Chandler</category><guid>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1911/05/22/from-grace-chandler-to-martin-chandler/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 1911 00:32:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>From: Grace Chandler, To: Martin Chandler</title><link>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1911/05/16/from-grace-chandler-to-martin-chandler-2/</link><dc:creator>admin</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140505_16525845_0200.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-590" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140505_16525845_0200.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140505_16525845_0200" width="1525" height="1046"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140505_16530732_0201.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-591" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140505_16530732_0201.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140505_16530732_0201" width="1543" height="1046"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
