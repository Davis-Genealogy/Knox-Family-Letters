Mr. John Roush,
No doubt you will be surprised to get this letter from me, but I thought I would do different from the way you did, and not walk in on you without giving you word of my intention on coming to Dunlap in the near future. That is if nothing happens here to prevent my leaving home, such as something pertaining to Annie. I am sick with worry and humiliation on account of the estrangement of members of our family, and you are the cause of it all. I am coming to Dunlap to make some inquiries about some things I want to know, also to see some of the Masons there, as I intend to inform them of your actions in bringing disgrace and sorrow to a brother Mason and his family, I am also an Eastern Star. I don't want to write letters to them. So will go see them. I do not intend to be there more than a week at the most. And don't expect to enter your home. I am enclosing clipping for your careful perusal. I am still,
Your Aunt&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>From: Unknown</category><category>Letter</category><category>To: John W. Roush</category><guid>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1920/04/20/from-unknown-to-john-w-roush/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 1920 22:46:21 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
