&lt;p&gt;From: Grace Chandler, To: Chandler Family&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday 8th '17
Dearest Folks
Will try to write you a few lines this am. Was so glad to hear from Mama yesterday. Doesn't matter to whom they are addressed, just so I get them.
Am feeling much better, one breast is still swelled, and I have the night sweats and a breaking out on my body caused from fever, But I am getting stronger every day now. Mrs. Kelley left Saturday P.M. and I bathed the baby yesterday and this morning. She is doing fine and everyone was out yesterday afternoon, then Mr. and Mrs. Geo Maxon and son wee out last night. Guess we'll keep having company, as so many have told Lorin they're so anxious to see the baby. He's going to try and get some pictures of her this noon.
Thanks to Grandma Chandler, she has another silver dollar to add to her savings. Don't think she should have done it, but we appreciate it. Lorin took her little bank up to the bank this A.M. He adds something every day I think. Mrs. Klingner and Mella were out after you left Mama and brought her a little solid gold hand ring.
The material Ruby has for her coat is so pretty and I'm sure proud of it.
Guess you'd be surprised, as we were shocked to hear Mr. Bartlett the Wabash agent here, committed suicide in the depot on Friday. No reason has been assigned to his rash act, but an auditor came in to check him up and a dray man testified at the coroners inquest that he had heard them arguing over some freight bills. Some additions that had been added to Paddock Lumber Co.'s bills. But other people think it was family affairs. Will send you the clippings from the papers if I can find them. He was the agent here for 7 years. It certainly was a shock to everyone as they were supposed to have been the happiest of families.
Am so glad to have Ruby here. She is so good to me, but I'll tell you I missed Mama and so did Mrs. Kelley. She spoke of you so often. Bess was so sleepy after talking all night that she layer down and slept in the afternoon and I had a lump in my throat all day. Ruby had spells over the "offspring" when she arrived and has never quite gotten over her yet. Wish everyone of you could see her.
Lorin is going to be in a minstrel show tomorrow night in Taylorville , some fellows pulled out at the last minute and they asked Lorin to take one place. He's to be an end man and has a prominent part. He's studying his song "Are you from Dixie" and his gags. Either Bess or Ruby will go to Taylorville and see it.
Wonder what causes Mama to get so dizzy? Mrs. Kelley had those kind of spells.
Yes, we let Mrs. Wilson know you had gone. She was called to St. Louis on Friday to take care of her niece, a trained nurse, who has pneumonia and expects will be gone for some time.
Mrs. Peuce (your advisor Mama) is also very ill with pneumonia. They have a trained nurse to care for her. Other box from fathers came after such a time. He sent the baby a powder puff, me a small picture of mother and a baby, a towel, and a box of stationary, and a lot of Christmas candy. Was nice of him to remember us. He sent each member of his family something. We heard from mother , three miners and she have taken more cold and was having lots to do.
Bess and Lorin went to Bartlett's funeral. It as held at the house hey said. There were oceans of flowers.
Will be glad to get Lucerne's drawings . Was so sorry to her Mary school her, but its all over now and it didn't hurt anyway did it Lucerne?
When little Jack was here, he went over to Waggners and told them we had a dog. They said "what kind of dog is it?" he said he didn't know. They asked if it was a bird do. He said, "No! This dog don't fly!" Ha.
Mrs. Waggner and Gladys came over the next day after you left. We have had lots of company.
Lorin just called up from town and said I had letters from home, but he had to go to Taylorvillle and won't be back until night. Said he'd send the letters down to the school house to Bess and I'll get them about 4 pm. I want to send this up by Bess this noon so I'll close for this time as she's ready to do back.
Love to Everybody,

Dearest Folks,
Getting along OK. Leave here today. Sure hope I can get a job. it's pretty cold down here but don't mind it much. Rather be traveling this way than to be laying round in Pearl. Sure would like to hear from yours. I can imagine what you all think of me for leaving this way especially while Grace and Lorin were there but think I'd rather be most anywhere than Pearl.
Next time I write I'll give you an address and want to hear from some of you.
Lovingly,
Martin&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Date Partially Unknown</category><category>From: Martin Chandler</category><category>Letter</category><category>To: Elijah H.

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received papas letter yesterday and Bess' dandy letter today and mighty glad to get them. I came over other night and wrote but forgot to mail it so guess it has been quite a while since you've heard from me. The 11th Reserve battalion left for France this morning. We got our lockers back this am also got stoves so guess we will camp here this winter from looks of things but of course can't tell for sure. I think they intended to send one battalion over and hadn't decided who to send hence our preparedness but now since the 11th have gone we're likely to stay here for some time. I've been getting the Pike Country Republican lately. Who's sending it? It has news from boys at Camp Taylor. Saw Wade's and Jesse's picture in it.
Tell Parish I'll write the Tribune a letter relative Army Life as far as I knew. Don't know anything about it except Signal Corps Branch. Awful glad to hear Knox's arm is healing. Hope he doesn't fall from some place and break it again before it mends. We've been out on target range 3 days out of this week and go again tomorrow. I can shoot pretty well. Scored 76 out of 100 first time. I even tho one of the automatic pistols. Lots pretty good shots in this company. Is Aunt Sarah still at our house?
They are offering liberty bonds to our company on installment plans. We have about 75 men and they're taken $4200.00 so far. I can't take any account the allotment home. Have o pay at rates $10.00 per month and thats all I'm getting. By the way, you'll get first payment 1st of December. Captain said it was paid one month behind June all the time and then you'll get the last one a month after I'm out of army. Gee Margaret is getting rather popular. Having  bunch of fellows wanting to call on her.
It's pretty chilly here. heavy frosts each morning. Well I'll stop now and go back to camp. Pretty tired tonight. On our feet all day today fixing stoves for the company. Will write again soon.
Lovingly,

&lt;p&gt;Dear Nett and all,
I will write you a few lines. Pa is lots better today. He is sitting up was out in front room this morning for quite a while. Martin had a letter to answer and share him so he looks better and he says he feels better. He is awful weak but can help himself so much better than he did. He started a line last night and I got up and mailed it. Him and me get along fine. Virginia is on my lap she wanted to know who I was writing to. She said do you want Aunt Nett will come down.
Well I will close

Dear Little Sister,
Got your letter this morning together with Margaret's and was sure glad to get it. By golly I wish you'd all write every day. Hang on to the iron kiddo. It will make a woman out of you. Gee that sure was a whole bunch of tough luck about that earache. Did you try warm milk and Laudanum? That's what Mama used to do for me when I was a kid. You want to read slow on this so it will last longer cause I haven't got time to write very much.
Well sweetheart the strike "haint" going to be pulled off so guess I'll work a while longer.
I sent Margaret 3 Simoleans to buy books. Forgot about her birthday Aug 26 but I'll try and remember March 10th.
Suppose you've been living in joyful anticipation of the coming Monday whence you will again enter the old school house. Well I gotta stop.
Write me right away quick,
Yrs,
Martin&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Date Partially Unknown</category><category>From: Martin Chandler</category><category>Letter</category><category>To: Unknown Chandler</category><guid>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1900/09/03/from-martin-chandler-to-unknown-chandler/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Sep 1900 20:47:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>From: Ruby Chandler, To: Grace Chandler</title><link>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1900/09/01/2554/</link><dc:creator>admin</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2555" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/postcard-2014-20150209_17492217_0440.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20150209_17492217_0440" width="2008" height="2917"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2556" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/postcard-2014-20150209_17491299_0439.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20150209_17491299_0439" width="1984" height="2886"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2557" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/postcard-2014-20150209_17493395_0442.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20150209_17493395_0442" width="2004" height="2913"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2558" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/postcard-2014-20150209_17492546_0441.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20150209_17492546_0441" width="1991" height="2872"&gt; &lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2559" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/postcard-2014-20150209_17495064_0444.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20150209_17495064_0444" width="1503" height="1039"&gt; &lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2560" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/postcard-2014-20150209_17494333_0443.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20150209_17494333_0443" width="1510" height="1042"&gt;From: Ruby Chandler, To: Grace Chandler

Dearest Grace;
Received your care today and was glad to get a line from you. Will send picture inclosed later. I brought it down from Mae this evening.
We are quite comfortably located now, will proceed to desirable rooms as near as possible. The room facing Cleveland Ave has one window on that side and one at the end. Have Mae's sanitary couch at that window - on the north that is - and the dresser in the corner. Have a white iron bed at the other end of room, a table in the center and a gas heater and two rockers, the other room is same size with one large window, and the entrance door, with a closet leading off. A fine place for my clothes and shelves for my hats. Have a dandy gas stove and over a kitchen cabinet with top, which I use for the dishes, a square dining table and the chairs, and a nice rug on both floors.
Mae and Art came up for supper, we had watermelon for desert. You never saw such big melons there and the biggest are $0.15. A $0.10 one was plenty and had some left and just think how much Martin and I eat. Say anything you want to do. Wont insult us a particle.
How I do wish it were possible for you to be here with me then I'd board you so you could go to business college too. There's a discount for two from same family.
I can swim to beat the dutch. Breast stroke and on my back, too. We all went this am quite a crowd there. Sam took me boat riding the other night and asked me last night to go again so you can bet I will. Haven't been to any shows yet, don't expect to for quite a while.
11 am Came up to Mae's after my work was done and I sent Martin for his books. He will go down to the college in the morning to get ready for Mon. I'll have to go to another teacher's meeting in the morning until noon.
I'll be glad when we both get started so we can keep busy. Received Grace's letter this am and I was so glad, had to shed a few tears.
I just love the place where I stay, but I'll have to get used to the surroundings before I feel at home.
What was some of the music Mr. Gorin sent you? Mrs. Davis has several of the new ones we knew.
Mae has a new vacuum cleaner just like ours. Martin sleeps on the sanitary couch and I used the iron bed. Plenty of room for a sister Ha.
I must quit so I can get your picture wrapped.
Mae had three peach trees just loaded with Alberta peaches and such big ones. This is the first year they've borne fruit.
I'll be anxious to hear from you so write.
Much love to all,
Ruby&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Date Partially Unknown</category><category>From: Ruby Chandler</category><category>Letter</category><category>To: Grace Chandler</category><guid>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1900/09/01/2554/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 1900 00:50:20 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
