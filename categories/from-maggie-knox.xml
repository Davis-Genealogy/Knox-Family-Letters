Dear Sister,
I will now attempt to answer your kids letter which I received on the 25th and was glad to learn of you all being well as it leaves us at present.
Well Nett I went to White Hall last Wednesday and came back Friday. Had an awful nice time while there. We attended the Strawberry and Ice Cream Festival Wednesday night and on Thursday, Luke Mc Junior and Frank Orten (my fellow) hired rigs and we went to Carrolton started about 10 o'clock in the morning and never got back till 5 in the evening so you can see for yourself how I enjoyed myself. White Hall is a beautiful little town. Lizzie Johnston and I went out to Green Pond yesterday to attend a declaration. I've had a real nice time, saw lots of folks. No I see you and Hill have not split yet. Nor is not likely to be. I don't think but if I was him I would get a little cranky if you run around with other fellows.
Well Nett Smith has gone up home this morning. He started before breakfast. He was pretty home sick. He had not been home for a week so you may know he wanted to see Ande and the children. Well Nett you must think lots of your silk dress from the way you talk. Well I believe. I would think as you great dear about me to think about.
Well Nett my tan lace has not come yet it is now 1 week since eI sent for it. I don't think they ever got my order for it. Well I need not be in any hurry about it any how for I am not going to make it till you and Annie comes home. I don't know whether that will be very soon or not. Hope it will.
Well Nett I got a letter from Will the same say I got yours and he said he did not think he could come home this summer. Oh I don;t want I'm to back out coming for I told you before how it was I am going to write to him this eve and insist on him coming. Will wrote me that a friend of his by the name of Kidd was visiting in White Hall. I made inquiries about him while I was there but I could find no one that knew him.
John and Jennie Martin still goes together. She is in Elesberry, Mo. now but they correspond all the time. I don't see what he thinks about to go with her. Stuart and Lizzie still goes together I think she is very foolish too to go with such a dog as Bill Stuart. She is keeping it all silent from her mother. Lou Hess goes with Lizzie Frazier yet.
Nett, Ma will send you $10.00 if you need any more just say. Well Nett I can't write very much this time, so I'll write no more now.
I am as ever your sister
Write soon,
Maggie
Love to all&lt;/p&gt;

Miss Nettie Knox,
Dear Sister,
I will now attempt to answer your kids letter also picture which I received 19th I was glad to hear of you all being well as it leaves us at present.
Well Nett I think the last picture you sent us was more like you than any yet but Ma likes the head and shoulders the best. Nett what dress did you have on.
Well they had or tried to have a dance at Garrison Wednesday night 19th but they only danced two sets till it broke up in a row. There was nobody there but some old women that is no on by my account.
Izora's folks are coming down tomorrow (Sat). Smith is going to drive 3 trucks on the Quarry at $6.75 per day. He starts to work next Monday. He is getting good pay if he will only keep it but I fear that will be the trouble with Smith when he gets to Pearl.
Well next month is the month that Will is to come home and I do hope he will come for we want to see him so bad. I hope by that time that you and Annie will be ready to come with him. Oh how glad would I be if I could see you all step off the train together. We are glad to hear that you are enjoying yourself so nicely. Are you still going with Hill. You did not say much about him in your last letter. He will get mad if you go to "flirting" around with other fellows. I wanted heard from "Gray" since last week. He got hurt very badly by a falling timber last Tuesday and has been laid up in bed so he could not move but he was sitting up yesterday. Nettie don't for goodness sake let Hattie mention to Pa anything that was in that letter I sent to you about him. Nett I have got a beautiful tan colored cashmere dress. Have sent to St. Louis for 6 yards of tan oriental lace today. Will send you a piece of both in my next letter. I am not going to make it till you and Annie comes home. I made a blue worsted dress last week, cut and  made every stitch myself.
No we have not got any new furniture since you left. Aunt Anna;s folks has not moved yet either but I guess they will move the first of August.
nett does Will keep constant company with any one. If he does tell him to put her aside till he comes home and I don't want him to stay only 1 or 2 weeks either when he does come we would like so well for you all to come soon especially Will for we think it would change Pa to some extent for Nett remember done let Will mention any thing to Pa about it.
Annie Coates is well but Aunt Sarah is sick. She had a head chill last Monday night and has been sick ever since but she is getting better now.
Well Nett I guess I will go to While Hall next Wednesday if nothing happens between now and then. Alex Crawford goes with Kate Honan and John Honan still goes with Annie Coates.
Lizzie said to tell you no that O'Brien did not have on a white hat when she saw him so I guess he is not the one.
Nett I don't see how you can keep up with such stylish people it wouldn't do for me to go out there for I don't know how to put on so much style. Nett Ligey said if you did not come home pretty soon he would strike out after you. Well I will have to write a short letter as my music teacher is coming today and I will have to practice my lesson. So I will close this time. Hoping to hear from you soon.
I am your loving sister,
Maggie&lt;/p&gt;

Dear Sister,
I will now attempt to answer your kind letter which I received on the 20th just and was glad to hear of you all being well as it leaves us all at present.
Well Nett we had a big snow last Sunday night but it is all gone now and nice and warm but the mud is not entirely dried up yet. Well Nett, Mrs. Ella Betts has got a big 9 and 1/2 lb girl born on the 10th. Will be 2 weeks old tomorrow. She is doing well for her country. I think most to well for her own good. Aunt Sarah is up there now. Went up last Friday. They are looking for her back today. Anna never speaks Ella's name. She feels pretty cheap but it don't help her running away any. She is on the street from morning till night. John is still on the section. He hasn't missed a day since he started work. We have about 25 boarders. Now there was 4 new men come yesterday, so we have our house full but oh my I wish we was out of the old place. I have got so tired keeping boarders. I don't know what to do with myself. Nett I haven't got none of my dresses made yet. I just finished Ma's dress last Saturday. I made it myself. Lizzie T just did the cutting. It is made polonaise and skirt with a width of velvet down the front of the skirt and cuffs and collars are velvet.
Lizzie Frazier has been here all week making Lizzie Johnston's black dress. It is awful pretty.
No Frank Williams has not come to see Lizzie yet but he tried to bring her home last Sunday night but Mr. Peters (the auctioneer) got in ahead of him but you bet Lizzie didn't want Peters a bit.
Oh Nett if you could just see Stuart the way he sneaks past the door he never looks in no more than if he knew any one.
Yes you bet when Anna andI go up to Ella's I will write and tell you all the particulars like we will go next week it is just as Anna takes the motion. It don't seem like that Uncle Jim or Aunt Sarah see's her (Anna's) actions but I think I would if it was me I would tame her down a little.
Nett you are always into some development. I think it I was you I would have been ashamed of knocking down poor little Lucy's house after her having it built so nice but that is just like you. I am glad she did smack you in the mouth. Tell her I said for her to smack you again for me for not coming home. Tell her I paid for her to get on the train and come any how and let you stay with your Hill if you can't leave him. I think "Old Saw" is just the name for you. It suits you splendid. Well Nett Mrs. H.S. Groin is getting "pretty large." She is going to St. Louis Thursday. She was down yesterday.
Oh yes Minnie Fulmer and N.S. Lacy was married at Harrick Laudess. I think her parents was opposed to her marrying who she did. Yes I saw Charlie Fulmer over at Dunk Mc's dance the next night after I went up to Izora's. He wanted me to go over to their house but I didnt get to go. Well Nett, it is nearly train time and I will have to close. Will write more next time.
Oh yes Nett, Ma said for you to hurry and answer this letter and send your picture in it and send me Hill's picture.
Be sure and send yours any how.
I remain your sister.
Write soon,

Miss Nettie Knox,
Dear Sister,
I will now try and answer your kind letter which I received 22nd and was glad to hear of you all being well as is expected of us at present.
Well Nett we are looking for Izora's folks down today to spend Christmas and O how we wish you and Anna was here too.
We have just killed two big turkeys. We have no help yet. Lizzie went home last Monday still grunting, and Ma and I have all this work. We thought that was another new dress you had got, we thought you was going to put on a happy dog. Have you got your black dress and that beautiful red made in Bella. Betts is not coming down till spring and I guess she will have company with her when she comes.
O yes about Mob Rose and Lansdon. Sadie Lewton found a letter that Mob had written to him but she wont tell what is in it. She has the letter - saving it so if any thing comes out she will have it to show.  Lizzie J says for you to write to her. Lizzie J made my dress. It is awful nice she just got it finished it is trimmed in velvet.
Mrs. Mearre is down sick with the lung fever. I guess Billie Shay is waiting on her.
O I am just crazy for you to come home. I want to see them sweet children so bad. Nett there is going to be a ball here tomorrow night in the Ha.. Both operations are boarding hereon. The night operation left Stathernsr and came here. He is awful cute. He isn't near as large as Sabrine. Lee says he is going to try to dance his first set tomorrow night.
Nett, Lon Woods gets married tonight to Belle Garrison and Mort Edwards was married Milton to a cousin of Lidia Kisey's. O yes tell Will that Mort Edwards was down yesterday and said he got a letter from Sabina the day before and she sent her regards to all the folks especially Willie. She is in Ohio.
Belle Berry is coming back the first of next month.
Well I wish I had some of those pretty toys out there because I don't expect any here. O it is the driest Christmas I ever say except the Saloons.
Tell the children I am as ugly as a muck fence.
Well Nett, Ma will send you $5.00 for yourself and $5.00 for the children to get them some presents. I guess that is all she can send this Christmas.
Well I haven't time to write any more. We are so busy now. With love to all and a portion for myself. I remain your loving sister,
Maggie Knox
Christmas gift to all.
Nett, Ligo is sick for two days but I guess it is grieving over you.

Miss Nettie Knox,
My dear sister I will now try to drop you a few lines in a  hurry as it is almost train time and I have been so busy I did not take the time to write any sooner. I was glad to get so long a letter from you and to hear of you all being well as it leaves us all at present. Well Nettie I am so delighted Jasper Walk just came off the noon train today and said that he had rode on the train from Alvin to White Hall with Willie and that he had gone to St. Louis to work in a  big drug store. I can't hardly believe it as I got a letter from Johnnie yesterday and he never spoke a word about it but then I suppose it is time I hope so any how for he will be so close to us.
Perhaps he can be home with us Christmas. O I only wish you all would be here. We are going to have a nice time tomorrow night. We are going to have a tree in the church . We expect a fine time, Papa wrote John &amp;amp; Will letters yesterday and sent you $2.00 and John $5.00. That is awful little bit is the best they could do. Momma intended to send you both some money but she never got but $3.00 of Lige's money this month. So of course she could not send any. Ella and Mr. Bills came home yesterday. They have an awful sweet little baby. Ella isn't as big as a thimble. She is the She is the least little bit of a scrap you ever saw. I guess she will send you one of the baby's pictures. She gave me one. O yes and so did Lige give me one of his pictures. I guess you know he had some taken in St. Louis. He received them yesterday I think they are awful nice. I think they would have been better if he had kept his hat off. He is getting awful good . He lets me see most every letter he gets from you and you can bet that strikes me. Well, Izora and I went to Milton yesterday. We left home at 1 am and got back at 6, so you can see we made a day trip. She got Vinnie a lovely cloak or rather the making of it. She could not get a ready made cloak in Milton for Vinnie. The cloth is beautiful. It was $2.00 per yard. Also got herself a cloak for $5.00 and got Myrtle and May two big China dolls. I have got the dressing of them to do today so as to be ready for the tree tomorrow tonight. Mamma got each of the girls a cap the same as I sent Liney and that is all she could get for them. I am so sorry in one way that Willie has gone to St. Louis as he will be so far away from John but then I'll bet John will get along. I do hope he will get a school or some employment in a store for I don't like for him to have to go on a farm but then he would not have to stick to that always. John was telling me in his letter about John and Lucy acting the free Methodist. I would like to see them. I'll bet it is equal to a circus. Well Nettie, Papa is writing a few more lines to John and he is waiting on me to get through so I will close. I know you can't read this for I have written t in such a hurry. Don't wait so long as I have done. I will also try to do better in the future. Wishing you all a merry Christmas and a happy new years.
I am your loving sister.
Maggie
