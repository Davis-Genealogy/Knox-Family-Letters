Darling Ruby,
I received your letter yesterday and was oh so glad. Ruby I'm so sorry but I've made arrangements to go up to Springfield that week. If I had got your letter a day sooner I would no have gone up there, for I'm sick to see you and just think, I wrote you some time ago and said I wanted to come and as I did not hear from you for so long I did not know what to think. How I wish you had written sooner and I need would have consented to go up there for I'd rather see you than anybody I know of. I just love you.
What a good time we could have had if I could only come. Say, how long do you get off-as much as two weeks? If so, I'll come over on the Saturday after the New Year's. This is if you have not started back by that time. The girl I'm going to visit up there is coming up with me on the Saturday before New Year's and staying til Tuesday a.m. Say, I'm sending your apron. I sure hope you will like it. I like the handle. Give all my love to all that blessed family of yours. Dear the more I think of it the more I want to be with you all. Wouldn't we be a happy group though? I know you'll have a grand time.
Lovingly your old pal,
Pearl E.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>From: Pearl Ellis</category><category>Postcard</category><category>To: Ruby Chandler</category><guid>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1911/12/22/from-pearl-e-to-ruby-chandler/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 1911 21:57:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>From: Pearl Ellis, To: Ruby Chandler</title><link>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1911/01/18/from-pearl-to-ruby-chandler/</link><dc:creator>admin</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140430_18001069_0144.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-471" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140430_18001069_0144.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140430_18001069_0144" width="1520" height="969"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140430_18001804_0145.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-470" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140430_18001804_0145.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140430_18001804_0145" width="1536" height="978"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

My dear Ruby,
Are you paying me back for the way I treated you dear? Well I don't like it. I want to hear from you. Did you ever get my photo I sent to you before Christmas? I was afraid you had not, as I had not heard from you. How is everybody? Give my love to all the family. I was at Knox's last Sunday. They are all well. Am getting a little tired of school. Had a fine time in Decater and Urbana during holidays.
Love,

My Dear Ruby,
Say i got your letter 6-11. Was mighty glad to get it but must disappoint you dearie. Will write as soon as I can and let you know all about lots of things. My school begins Monday and I dread it like everything. I have been having one good time. Ward is here you know. He will leave a week from Saturday. Am awfully sorry Ruby. Would love to see you and I know we would have a good time but I can't leave Ward now. I won't see him for one year. Oh my.
