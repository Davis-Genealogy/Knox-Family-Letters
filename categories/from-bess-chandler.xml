&lt;p&gt;From: Bess Chandler, To: Elijah H. Chandler
Mailed From: Washington, DC on January 30, 1918 (Letter was originally sent to Bess Chandler from Martin Chandler on December 20, and then sent to Elijah H. Chandler from Bess Chandler on January 30, 1918)&lt;/p&gt;

Dearest Bess,
Received your dandy letter this am and the invitation to Ruby's wedding and sure glad to get them. Only wish I could be there.
We were scheduled to leave yesterday but wont leave until Saturday now on account headquarters haven't got all their stuff loaded. We're sure going across this time though. I'm sorry I haven't had any pictures taken but its too late now. Didn't draw any pay last paw day so I've been broke. We might possibly get paid in Hoboken before leaving there and if we do I'll sure have some taken and have them sent home.
Lordy wish I could be home for Christmas. This will make about 4 Xmas' I've missed at home.
Guess you all have been pretty busy sewing and getting ready for the wedding.
Glad to hear Grove has a good job. Hope he stays with it.
I received Papa's letter last night. Sorry to hear they are going to take off the Helper.
Well Bess don't know a whole lot to write. We haven't any thing to do now except wait for orders to embark. All of our horses and boxes have gone. Sure hope you all enjoy a merry Christmas and happy New Year.
I'd like to have had another one of those angel good cakes before leaving but no chance now. Think they are pretty strict about sending anything to France.
Will write soon as we get over.
Love,
Martin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On back of last page:
Was mistaken about this being the letter which spoke of this instance. It was the letter he wrote before this one to me. When you find it wish you'd send it to me. I want to see what he said about it too.

&lt;p&gt;Dearest Folks,
Didn't send that good as I didnt love the braid. Have sent David Loutcuer, so will send it as soon as I get braid. We are all still busy sewing. Expect to start home next Wednesday.
Lots of love,

I'm sending you your Christmas gift. Hope it fits this time. I think it is real pretty.
Grace has written Mamma a letter which I'm mailing. I'm at the P.O. and just got mom's letter and the magazine. Haven't read letter yet. Write soon. You write such nice letters.

Dearest Mama, Papa, and all
I've just gotten cleaned up and thought I had better write. We had intended to go to Taylorville to a football game but something was the matter with the car. I did want to go so bad, but I'm going to Jane Carrie's house to see about a party the Glee Club is to give Thursday night.
I got along all OK with my recitation. I've had so many compliments on it. Nearly every time I'd see anyone who was there, they'd tell me how well I did.
You know I told you that some Taylorville Ladies came down and organized a Hilson Ladie's Club. Well Mrs. Pence was appointed as a committee of one to arrange for a Glee Club. She asked me and six other girls and we sang here, at Harvel, and at Taylorville. Our songs were real cute. We had one to the tun of My Little Girl - Oh Mr. Hughes you're stock are dropping
You are losing notes each day
Oh Mr. Hughes we hear you're knocking
Tho you're many miles away
We read your talks in all the papers
What you've promised not to do
Oh Mr. Hughes we know you're lonely
But we can not note for you
We had lots of other ones too and some Wilson yells. While we were at marvel a man gave us five dollars, so were going to have a party on it. We get to invite "our company" - Don't know who to invite. The ladies of Tayloville treated us so nice and altogether we've had lots of fun. We'll know Tuesday who is to be our president.
I got my coat while I was at Taylorville. It's brown velour. I did want a plush with brown fur trimming but they were too expensive.
Hope I get to come home Thanksgiving but guess I wont if I don't get a pass because my fare would be nearly six dollars. I'll sure be home Xmas tho' and get to stay from Dec 22 to Jan.
Hope you are all well - I'm getting along fine at school. We had a program in my room day before yesterday. It was real good. The girls asked me to sin so I sang Little Gray Home in the West. We had company, too.
Lorin has just offered Grace and I $0.15 each if we read something against Wilson in the Republican news paper. You couldn't pick up a republican news paper without reading something against Wilson. In fact that's about all it contains.
I'm enclosing a five with which I want to pay my lodge dues for the past four or five months. Guess it wont come amiss if everything is as high as it is here. Flour is $3.00 a sack. You never did say whether or not you got the other $5.00 (which I borrowed to buy shoes in Springfield) I returned but I guess you did because you got the letter. I've got all of my debts paid now, Pearl Store, my board, Donohoo's, Ruby, and you. I wrote to Mrs. Moultrie too - All I owe, now is a letter to Ruby and I'll try to write it soon. Martin never did answer my letter. When you write tell him I'm looking for one. Lot's of Love,
Bess&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday
Dearest Papa, Mama, and all,
Sure do thank you for then five. Came in handy but I want you to know I earned the money to pay for my Xmas presents. Got $22 for my first case of nursing. No I didn't either, Mae gave me $10.00 for staying with her. I didn't want to take that but she just insisted and as I was altogether broke it looked awfully good. Then at Temps I stayed one week and 3 days for $22. Didn't have anything to do but take care of the little girl. They treated me fine and invited me to stay over Xmas with them and eat turkey dinner but I wanted to eat with the girls. When I left the little girl I was nursing gave me an Xmas present. The sweetest little apron with tattling all around the the pieces set together with tatting wasn't that nice? I have another place now out on College Hill. Three people down and I'll get $30.00 a week here. I gave M &amp;amp; L $5.00 between them after Xmas. Lucerne is going to get her a pair of shoes. Margaret got hers and I got mine. They are awfully good looking.
Our Xmas we sent home looked kind of slim didn't it? I just had one day to shop and I had to wait until I made some money to shop with. I was picking out Xmas cards and found one like the one we sent home. I thought it had lots of good thoughts and it also there was a lot of loving thoughts with out gifts. Grace sent me a pair of silk stockings and Mae gave me a pair too. Mrs. D.D. gave each M, L, and I a drop de china handkerchief. They surely treated Ruby and Sam as well as the rest of us lovely- R &amp;amp; S were going to eat Xmas dinner over there and us girls over to Mae's but we changed plans and we all ate over to Mary's and such a dinner. We had a regular one - I'll let Ruby tell you what she got. Ruby was awfully blue because Sam had to go back.
Margaret has the flu and so far as I can hear is getting along fine. I have to hear thru Mae - She sent her thermometer down by Art. Mae said she would have taken care of Margaret rather than to have her down home at 215 E Dewey but she wasn't strong yet herself. If Ruby and Lucerne need me I'm willing and ready to go but I thought $30.00 isn't picked up every week.
Do you hear anything from Martin? Bet he;s anxious to get home. Sure was glad to hear you were all better at home. Ruby, M, and L gave me a flowered petticoat and some handkerchiefs. Think I've told you everything Old Santa brought me now. I made Art and the boys a plate of homemade candy and have Mae a pair of Manicure scissors. When did the things arrive home? The girls hadn't done any shopping to speak of and M and I did most of it Xmas Eve day. The day I went home from Temps.
The baby is getting along fine and Ruby looks well.
Hope to hear from you soon
Love,
Bess&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Entire Date Unknown</category><category>From: Bess Chandler</category><category>Letter</category><category>To: Elijah H.
