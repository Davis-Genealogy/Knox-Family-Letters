&lt;p&gt;From: Ruby Chandler, To: Manca&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday A.M.
Dearest Manca,
I will write just a note at this time and enclose any letters that have come since I wrote last. Bess said she'd write herself today so she can tell you anything I have left out.
Bess came yesterday (Sun.) noon and Papa was at home too so we had a good visit. She looks fine. She brought each of us something new and brought you a new dress which we'll make and send you. I want you to visit until your pass limit and rest assured that perhaps all things wont go to "rack and ruin." Anyway we might get some sewing done for you under stress of your necessity especially while visiting and you know  how much that knowledge of necessity can cause us to accomplish at times so we'll try to get another little package to you before long. I'm sure I appreciate and thank Aunt Annie's kindness in giving you such a fussy dress. That's just like her. I was talking to several down at the soldier's banquet about Uncle's death and they all had praises for Aunt Annie.  Clem Hanback talked as if she Aunt had been her bosom friend.
I'll send you the papers, too. Martin sent his card here for registration as you'll see by his letter. Papa had the garden in perfect condition also the lawn and has poled the beans, latticed the tomato plants and planted radishes. Annie has been all I could wish for the past several days. Love to all.
Lovingly,
Ruby&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Entire Date Unknown</category><category>From: Ruby Chandler</category><category>Letter</category><category>To: Manca</category><guid>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1900/01/01/from-ruby-chandler-to-manca/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 1900 23:23:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>From: Unknown, To: Art F.

&lt;p&gt;To Annie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Annie,
It's true I have not been writing to you much, since Nettie went up there knowing that you had a chance to hear from some of us pretty often. Would say we were sorry to hear of you being somewhat under the weather but hope ere this you are all right. Bad colds are very common now everywhere. The weather being so changeable no doubt is the cause. Your Ma and I have both had colds and Johnie had a fearful cough at night especially. He is now working everyday now on the section with Honan. Seems to like it very well of course. Mr. Honan is a good friend of his which is some difference. Boys must not have sister do too much and he is all the boys. You tell him I am having this boy in training. He says he know he can output him because he don't fall down. We are not getting impatient but ply want to see you a lll. Still more so as the expected time draweth near, I see no reason why George cannot come. It is only awhile spent and we all have to submit to losing time if any of us get sick. Try to get him to come. I like the tone of your last letter. It sounds as though you are coming some time , as I said, no use in waiting to get ready. Maggie is now making the machine work and has been for some days, so she will be in practice and have the machine in good order. Maggie is a machinist . She has just finished a dress for her Ma, Lizzie, and herself by some help from Lizzie F. Se says she will teach you all some new styles after you get here. I I suppose the children will be almost as big as she is, as she does not grow a bit. Still she is real handy to do anything she undertakes to do. I have not had a letter from Willie for some 10 days or more. Suppose he is well. He spoke of having bad colds-this is now a fair day. This after noon, but oh how muddy was the slush and snow. Nettie say you have got very big. That will be some surprise to us to see how having got so fresh. Iowa soil must be healthy for you folks as Nettie looks much fresher than when she left. I mean in her posture. Willie talked some of going west. Do you know anything about it? He merely mentioned that he had some notion to do so, but did not say when or positive about it. I will now close as the evening meal is about here and want to send this out. Respects to you all. Hoping to see you all soon in good health and in good spirits. I am as ever your Pa-

&lt;p&gt;Say you'd better quit telling "fellers" about that "Morus Chain" or write and explain. You've gotten my curiosity aroused.

&lt;p&gt;Fri Eve 5:40 P.M.
At Home&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dearest One,
As I feel so lonely this P.M. thought I would write you as I haven't seen you for two or three evenings. That is to converse with you. Sorry it was so that we could not be together last eve. Trusting it will so be I could see you at Sunday School next Lord's day if not before, trust it will be before. Was up past the house last PM. But could not see you - yourself and your sister's family's my sincere heartfelt sympathy in your and their trouble. Trusting the little one will continue to get better. Sorry dear you thought I was mad the eve we were conversing at a distance I sure was not and Margaret I am more than willing to say please a thousand times for you and also do anything I can for to please you.Dearest I will be up by the house at 8 o'clock P.M. and if you can see me a moment would be a pleasure to me. But if not will wait til it is convenient. Trusting you will not think I have advanced a step that I had ought not to of done by writing this.
But dear when I do not get to see you regularly I am lost - I don't know what I will do when you go to the city.
Margaret - take good care of yourself and do not get sick - as I know you are worn out for you was up all night you must retire early this P.M. and get your regular rest.
Will Close

Have promised myself to write you a long letter soon. This is just a forewarner. Hows Uncle? and all the rest. Haven't forgotten any of them. Had a telegram from Ruby saying she got $75 per month and guess someone told you I got a raise too? We're living on EZ street at present.  Papa and Mama went to Pittsfield last Monday.

&lt;p&gt;From: Betty and Harold, To: Millie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday
Dearest Aunt Millie,
Again I say I am sorry because I have waited so long to write. About August 10th I took Meiser to Colorado in order to avoid hay fever season in Kans. In less than a week after that I received a long distance phone call from Harold's doctor in Hearth Platte, Nebraska telling me Harold was seriously ill in hospital with pneumonia. Louie's wife went to Colorado to care for mother and I left Colo. for He. Platte and joined Harold. He was well enough to leave He. Platte in about three weeks. So we left and we came to Kansas City to see this Dr. Jere who operated on Harold five years ago. We were mistaken about Harold being able to make the trip to Kansas City so back to hospital we went again where he remained another two weeks. He is conversating now and Wed. of this week we go to Topeka for three weeks more of rest. Meier is being brought to Topeka today from Colorado. I am well considering every thing I have seen thru this summer.
I do hope dear you are comfortable and that hay fever did not get you down this summer. Also hope your little dog is well and still with you as I know he is company for you.
Bertie is busy as ever. Louie returned from Europe early last spring and will make no more trips abroad til peace is definitely declared over there which I fear is a long ways off.
Weather here now is beautiful but we had a very hot summer as Ks. always does have.
Hope to hear from you soon and that the report of you health will be favorable.
Lots of love from both of us.
Betty &amp;amp; Harold&lt;/p&gt;
