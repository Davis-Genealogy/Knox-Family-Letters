My Dear Wife
I will write you this morning. This is the first chance I have had to write any. I got here in the after part of last night. Am well and I trust this will find all of you well. I am awful anxious to hear from you but I can not say yet whether I will get to go to Prescalt or not. This being Sunday I have no chance to see any one so I can find out whether they will grant me a pass or not. This is a nice city and the people are very sociable. I am tired from riding on the cars. Did not get to sleep very much until this morning went to bed about three o'clock and sleep till eight. I saw some nice country coming down here and some very rough. It rained from the time I left K City Friday morning until some time in the night and then commenced S. morning and snowed until yesterday evening. There is some snow on the ground here and the mountains are wet with snow. The snow was 14 inches deep in Colorado and I thought some time the train would stop they went so slow. I can't hardly describe how it looked going up the mountains. The train had two heavy engines and they did not go as fast as a man could walk. I will not try to give any further description of the country but will tell you when I come home. If I don't get passed over the A &amp;amp; P I will not go to Prescalt. If I do get them I will telegraph to you so you can write to me. Everything here is high and I can't afford to fool away money trying to dead head my way with train men. I would give any thing if I was with you and the children now. Kiss the children for me. Tell Vinnie I think of her too. I have written to you each morning since I left. I hope you are enjoying your self. I will close and write to you again tomorrow but not until often I find out what I am going to do. I will have to stay here tonight I guess.
Good bye,
From your Loving Husband,

Dear Nettie
Your kind letter of 21st. Just saw and read with great pleasure. I will try to answer this eve. I was in hopes the next letter I got from you I would hear you was going to be for home right away. Well two weeks want be very long to want because I am very anxious to see you. I went to the festival the other night and had a very good time but didn't have any pictures. I am just about sick today and have been for two or three days. I was up till about one o'clock the night of the festival. Then Winslaw woke me at 2:30 to work for him. He came to St. Louis. So I had to work that day and till 12:15 the next night. So I guess that is what the matter with me. The men have had a bad time this pat day. It was raining and many of them were at work. So, the most of them got stuck or usual. This is a fine day and all the men are at work and I am glad of it. I get disgusted with lots of old drunken men. Well, I do wish you had come home in time to have taken  sleigh ride. maybe it will snow again before winter's close. If it doesn't I expect it will snow next winter but I don't like to wait so I'll leave it at that. I am at a loss to know what to write today, nothing worth writing about. Oh, certainly I will excuse you for not answering that letter as you was busy and fixing to come home. But not for anything else. Well I guess I will have to close for want of something to write. But never mind I will pay up when you come home. Yes be sure to let me know when you are coming. I would be happy to come meet you. Hoping to heat from you again soon.
I am Yours Truly,
E.H. Chandler&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pearl, January 6th '87
Dear Nettie,
I just received your kind letter of January 1st and was glad to hear from you. I have been looking for a letter for three or four days. I am sorry your face and hands both broke out like you told me but I hope you will be all right soon. I read one of your letter you wrote to Maggie some time ago about your face being broke out but you did not say anything to me about it before. There is nothing new to write. Good snow on the ground and has been awful cold for the last week. Maggie and Lizzie went sleigh riding today. They went up to Lizzie's mother. They just got back at 6 pm. No I haven't been sleigh riding yet this winter. One reason I have not went was because I did not have a sleigh and don't have such time to look after one. But I expect if you was here I could find time and a sleigh too. Willie is here yet. He lost his pocket book the other day with about 30 dollars in it. That's what I call bad luck. I got a litter from Soruby today. He wanted me to write him a letter of recommend. I did not have time today, will tomorrow. One of the Broker men on the way freight going East this a.m. got both legs cut off. I did not see him as it happened at Roadhouse. Frank Ward was down the other day but he didn't call in to see Lizzie. I guess William has got him done up. Mrs. Laux has moved back to the Cattoye Hatil again, Siul's had their dance new year's eve and had a big drunken fight. We had a show in town today. A man and a bear. The man was leading the bear and about 5 hundred kids after him more or less. No Anthany has not been here for some time. Maynard has gone to Nebraska. They have not done anything about the church house yet. The people of Old Pearl would give up the house out there. There is a petition here in town asking to the trustees to donate 5 hundred dollars of the town money to build a Christian church. The most of the people have signed it. I can't say how it will be fixed. I haven't heard from Phillips since I wrote to you. Only I asked the man where he had gone. He said P. was working at Waun on the I and 5th. Oh no, I don't think you could do anything with me if you was here. I just make the girls fly around. I expect I would do you the same way if you was here. Well, the girls could get away with me now if they knew I was crippled. I fell down on the platform yesterday and hit by back on a plank. It's pretty sore but I did  not tell any of them so they think I am OK. I don't want you to tell Maggie about it. If I had been there new year I bet I could have fixed your hair for you but I guess you have combed it before now. Well I have written all I can think of this p.m. Give my regards to all. And my love to you.
Your's Truly,
E.H. Chandler&lt;/p&gt;

Dear Nettie
Your warm, kind letter of love, just received and read with great pleasure. Will now try and answer too. Has been a long time since I heard from you but I hope to see you soon then that will pay for waiting. Mrs. Attwell died last night, funeral service tomorrow at the church house. They have sent for Brother Authey to lead the funeral and have not got any answer yet. I don't know whether he will agree or not. I got a letter from Mr. Weedles today. He said if I thought Jae could do the work I might send him to Sinclair next Tuesday morning. Now I am going to let him try it. If he works a failure I can't help it. Sinclair is a small place and not hardly any thing to do so if he can't get along there he can't anywhere else. Yes Jae and Will Maymard are going with the Well's girls and I think they are both pretty boldly gave. I am all right today. I had the tooth taken out before I received your advice about it. I went to Sailor's Lament  last night at the church house. it was very good. Yes I think you had better write when you will reach Whitehall as a letter might be delayed. The Crusher is not working this week they have a breakdown. There will be a good change for a sleigh ride yet this winter. Although there aint any snow on the ground here but it looks like snowing. Now I have told you all. I love to write to you but hope I won't have to write any other time. Write please, see you soon.
Yours truly,

Dear Nettie,
I just received your kind letter of 16th will try and answer this pm. I was glad to hear from you and to hear you have concluded to come home. Well if you can let me know what day you will start for home. If you come by the way of White Hall let me know what day you will be there and I will meet you in Whitehall and if you should take a notion to come soon other way let me know. I was surprised when Maggie told me the other day that you was coming home. You can imagine about how glad I was but I can't tell you. When you get this letter and are going to start soon. Answer about 2 days before you leave and be sure and say what day you expect to reach Whitehall. Now will not write but a short letter this time but hope to see you soon then I can tell you all. I am busy today. Mae is sick. I guess he has not been at the depot today. Oh, yes we had quite an explosion at the quarry last night or this morning, the powder house exploded. No one hurt as there was no one there but Matt Mulligan and he happened to be out of the way. There was 7 hundred pound went off. It made a big rocket. It woke me up. So you may know it had to be pretty loud. Now will close hoping to hear from you soon.
I am yours truly,
E.H. Chandler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it's necessary you might let some of us know by where what day you start. But it wont be necessary if you can start a letter one day before you start.

Dear Nettie,
I received your kind letter yesterday and was glad to hear from you again as I always am. I will try and answer this morning but don't know how I will make it. Nothing to write about. They are going to have a festival at the church house next Friday night. They had a county meeting last night. Everybody is going to the fox chase today. I was glad to hear you are getting all right again. Yes I suppose the Dr. thought you was a good patient. He gave a visiting when he went to see you. I will be glad when your time is out in Iowa. It seems to me like you have been gone 6 years now. I let Maggie read the letter you wrote in answer to the one I told you about falling down on the platform. She liked to have taking a fit about it. I think the snow will go off and spare the sleighing if it don't turn cold pretty soon. This morning looks like a spring morning. Well I will be glad when spring comes again. I am getting tired staying in side so much. When does Johny think he will come home? Yes Nettie your letters are all interesting to me whether they are long or short. I don't think Jae will get a job soon but he could if he was a good operator. Theres a good chance for Operators now on this road. I thought yesterday I would see what Jae would do if he was alone. So I told him when the conductor signed the order to get it corrected. I was out in the passenger room. Jae gave the conductor signature to the order. Then the dispatcher asked him if the train was all ready to go. Jae near made him any answer then asked him again and Jae asked him what he said. Then the dispatcher said where is E. By that time I went in and fixed them up. It seems to me that Jae don't try to learn anything. I have gave him a good chance but I am not going to recumbent him until I know he can do what they want him to do. Jae has made a move on all of the Wells girls. Him and Billy Maynard both go out to Wells. Now they are awful thick. Now I will close for this time. Hopeful to hear from you soon. With all my love to you.
I am yours Truly,
E.H. Chandler&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>From: Elijah H.

Dear Nettie,
Your kind letter of 25th received today. I was surely glad to hear from you. Oh yes I got the cup yesterday. Everything in good order I think it is awfully nice and is a very suitable gift. I haven't used it now yet. Maggie was awful anxious to see what was in the box for her. I opened it then went over to the house to tease Maggie. I told her I got the cup but there was nothing for her.
Willie K arrived last night from St. Louis. He thinks he will remain in Pearl awhile. There is king to be a concert Friday night at the church house. Oh yes I got a Christmas card from Miss N. of Jacksonville but I knew it by the handwrite on envelope. There is a good snow on the ground. If you were here I would like to go sleigh riding. I haven't had a ride this winter. Willie was asking me about Miss Emma. I expect he will be out sleigh riding pretty soon. I think they are going to have a big time at Duke's Saturday night.
I am having a good time this week not much work to do, but I expect to pay for it after the holidays are over. I guess you have a good time buying Christmas presents for the children. We'll I hope you may have  a good time new year, there aint nothing going on in Pearl today and nothing to write about. I believe you can beat me writing good long letters. Well I will have to close for this time. Hoping to hear from you soon.
I am your truly,
E.H. Chandler
P.S. I heard from Phillips today. Jr was talking to him on the well. He is working nights at Edwardsville junction for another road.

Dear Nettie,
I will try and answer your kids letter that I received yesterday. I was truly glad to hear from you as I am always thinking what day I will get a letter from you but this time I am afraid it will be a good while for I have not answered the other letter I received 3 or 4 days ago. I will ask you to excuse me this time and I'll promise not to do so anymore. I have been so busy I did not have time to write. The river has froze over and all the freight comes by rail. I had 15 thousand pounds freight to take care of yesterday and had the crew of the Mattie Bell here. They all went to St. Louis. Just fourteen number. There are lots of trains running and I am trying to get out my reports now. So you can see that I have been usually busy. Yes I am sure you will enjoy yourself while Johny is there till I hope he will find a good situation for the winter. Yes I think most any thing will beat railroading. We had an election on the 1st of this month. Sam McKee Flatan and Will Clauinger Flatan. Got 9 Votes. McKee 47 and Clauinger 48. I do not know where George Steelewell lives. His wife is at home but George has skipped out. I suppose you have heard of his trouble have you not. Every body is having a good time in Pearl. Frank Wood is in town I think. Lizzie J is having a good time. There hasn't been anything new in Pearl since I wrote to you last. If you was here I could tell you lots but I can't write it. Haven't been at church for a week. There is church, a green pond tonight if you was here we would just got flying as there is a good snow on the ground. I can not write a very long letter this time but the next time I will not be so busy then I will write you a long letter if can think of enough to write.
Winslow and get a long bass. He is awful good to help. Now Nettie I must close. Have a hard days work before me hoping to hear from you soon.
I Remain Yours Truly
