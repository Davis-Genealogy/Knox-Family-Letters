Dear Sister,
Enclosed find $15.00 all the change we have in the store this evening. IF you need more let me know and I will furnish it as I don't want you to be out anything. I wanted to give Nettie some money while here and told her if she needed anything to let me know it. I want her to look as nice and neat as any of the girls and she shall if I can do anything to help it. I seen Delia Sunday eve. and she said she would call on Nettie soon. I received an invitation this eve. from Sidney to attend a party of Laird's on Friday evening and will decline not knowing whether Nettie will be ready to go. They telephoned to me to know whether I would come and will answer in the morning.
Hope Nettie will be ready to go out soon.
Your Bro,
Will&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Envelope Included</category><category>From: William Thomas Knox</category><category>Letter</category><category>To: Anna Roush</category><guid>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1885/04/10/form-william-thomas-knox-to-anna-roush/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 1885 00:56:59 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
