Mrs. E.H. Chandler,
Dearest Aunt and all,
Thought I would drop you a few lines to let you know I was still in the land of living. I have been here two months. Sent here from Detroit , Mich. for Stone and Webster. I am working for Audy Carnegie as Master Mechanic over the gas engine and sram shovels. Drawing $300.00 per month. We are building a large steel mill here ad a neighborhood of 1400 houses. Most all of my work is in gas engines. Now aunt Nett, I want you to write me all the news and I want the girls to write also. Where is Martin at now? Suppose Ruby and Sam is married. Now how is Uncle Elijah? Tell him not to be backwards. Might ship me a line. Would sure appreciate it. I will leave her for Philadelphia the first of the year, building a ship yard. Though would like to hear from you all soon for there is nothing so cheery as a letter from home. How is Aunt Sarrah and what did Grace name the Babe? Don't know anything more to write.
Your Nephew

Friend Nettie,
I take pleasure in dropping you a few lines. I wrote to you some few days after you went away and mailed the letter to Pearl, but was to late to reach you, but I suppose it was forwarded to you, or at least I heard you got it. I was surprised to think you would not answer it, even you was so far away. You was not so far away but when you got it. Would like for you to write and explain why you didn't answer. I don't like to be treated so. Is your parents opposed to me corresponding with you, or do you not want to yourself. If so, all you got to do, is to say so, and that will close our correspondence at once.
Hoping to hear from you. I will close.
G.C. Hoover
P.S. Excuse fast writing as  am in a hurry.
