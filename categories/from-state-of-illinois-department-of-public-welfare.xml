&lt;p&gt;From: State of Illinois Department of Public Welfare, To: Jeanette Knox Chandler
Mailed From: Jacksonville, Illinois on April 22, 1920&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mailed Address:
Mrs. E.H. Chandler
P.O Box 101
Pearl, Illinois&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return Address:
After 5 days, return to
1201 S. Main St.,
Jacksonville, Ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dear Mrs. Chandler:
Your communication in reference to the parole of your daughter, Miss Anna Chandler, has been received.
In reply I beg to state that inasmuch as you were not able to give her proper supervision when she was living at home with you we do not deem it wise to parol her. I understand that your daughter Bessie May Chandler is working at Pittsfield, Illinois and is making good and probably she would be able to do something for her sister, by taking her away from her old home and surrounding. I would be pleases to have you take this matter up with your daughter and if she can give Anna proper supervision away from the old environment, where she got into difficulty we might consider your application again.
Thank you for the communication, I beg to remain
Yours very truly,
E.L. Bill
