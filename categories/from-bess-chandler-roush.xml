Dearest Mamma and all of you,
I was so glad to get your good letter but I thought you seemed a little homesick so though I'd do what I could to cheer you up. Of course by this time you'll have Knox's letter which will at least give you recent news of us. I had a letter from Lucerne a few days ago in which she said she had a letter from Mart saying he was feeling fine and hadn't had a drink since Thanksgiving and was working at the A.P in Milwaukee a few hours a day or whatever time they needed him for.
I thought it was so sweet of you to think of making something for Margaret and I think it would be lovely if you'd piece her a quilt. I'd send you the material and pattern if that wouldn't be too much for you to do. The big day is to be June 9th and between now and then we are all going to be on the move.
Aunt is quite a lot better now up all the time but not able to go yet or do anything.
Friday afternoon John and I went in to see the Patriotic program in which Wayne participated. Then Friday night we (excepting Aunt) all went to Margaret's Box Supper Program and Dance gel in her school. She had real good music donated but she didn't make near as much money this time as she did in October.
he coming marriage is beginning to seem more real all the time. She and her fiancé went to Ousha yesterday to purchase some of their furniture - a living room suite, one chair rug, bed room suite, and dinning room suite (six chairs, table, and buffet). They got so tired that they quit shopping and went to the Orpheum. Bill had the money with which to purchase the furniture and he is also buying teams harness and farm machinery and feed for stock - everything to farm with. He takes possession of the farm the first of March so he will batch until they are married. We are planning on a big wedding - or at least it sounds big to me. John and I are going to get silver like mine for her.
Sure glad to get first hand information from the Mullhollands. Sounds as if they have a real thriving store.
Knox and Wayne first left to go over to Hellers. They have a house pool table and all of them down to the four year old shoot pool.
John has the contract to furnish the gravel for the new Catholic Church. They will haul 400 tons this coming week - all the work is to be donated - the tearing down of the old building and all the hauling and everything that can be done by the men. But they will have an architect design the building. The Hellers donated $1000 besides a lot of work.
Margaret and I are embroidering a lot of things - last week we did a linen luncheon cloth 60x60 and six napkins - and we had just finished a bedroom set consisting of 2 long scarfs and one vanity set and pin cushions and now we are working on another set of pillow cases, dresser scarf, and vanity set.
We have had some terribly cold weather. Last Friday morning the thermometer registered 5 degrees below zero and had been below zero most of the mornings in February. One month from last Friday will be Good Friday too and time to plant spuds. Can you believe it?
Well, I reckon I've written everything. Maybe you've had letters from all by now. Lu is the only one I owe. Let me know if you want me to send the goods fro the quilt.
Much Love,
Bess&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>From: Bess Chandler Roush</category><category>Letter</category><category>To: Jeanette Knox Chandler</category><guid>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1929/02/25/from-bess-chandler-roush-to-jeanette-knox-chandler/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Feb 1929 22:17:59 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
