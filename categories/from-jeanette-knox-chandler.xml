My Dear Ruby:
Just now I heard the honk, honk of an auto in front of the door but just thought it was Lewis. Then I asked Lucerne to look out and see, and it was the Smarts of Milton come down  to meet May, and May was with him. She said Vinnie had sent her word to come at once as Lisa was so much worse. She asked for you and wanted you to go up with her. I wish you had been here, for it seems that none of us has been of any assistance to them. May then asked if I could jump in and go as you was not here, but of course I couldn't leave just now, and I feed so bad about it too. And Dr. is away in hospital too, and I guess that makes Lisa feel that there is no one to look out for him. I would liked to have heard how Uncle Jim is today. Mr. Johnson was asking me how he was, and said if it hadn't been for Aunt Sarah he wouldn't have been down there. I told him that was the place for him for there were so many of them all there and so good to take care of him. He said if he didn't change his mind he was going down there next Monday.
We washed today and I am tired out. Didn't get done till after noon. I hope Aunt Sarah is feeling all right. Annie did not say in her letter but I guess if there had been anything the matter with her, she would have mentioned it. I am making corn salad now just started on it about those little onions I wrote you about. I wouldn't get them if they are a big price. 40 per gallon is plenty to pay for them. I must stop now.
Love to all,
Mamma&lt;/p&gt;

Mr. E.H. Chandler
My Dearest Friend,
Your most welcome letter received last eve and perused with the greatest of pleasure and now I will try to write a few lines in answer. It seems if you have the same kind of weather there as we have here, I will get to take a sleigh ride with you sure enough if it does not turn warm and thaw the snow off before I get there. It is snowing very fast this am and there is a good deal of snow already on the ground. There is no fear of my changing my mind about coming home for I am only to anxious to get started. I expect I had better  wire you what time I will start. Annie think stat would be best. I am truly sorry to hear of you suffering so much with your tooth. Annie say's for me to tell you that she said for you to have that tooth taken out immediately.  So I guess you had better do so.  I have not received my money from home yet as Maggie said she would send it in next letter. I expect it today or tomorrow. Then after that gets here there is no telling what time I will rack out for home but I should say, rather shortly. I have felt sorry many times because I did not answer that letter of yours because since then, instead of getting two letters from you, I only get one in the same length of time and it seems such along time to wait for one letter comes until I get another from you, but Oh! how nice to think, we will soon see each other and then can talk instead of writing. Not that I tire of writing oh no - I have always found that a pleasure. But it will give me more pleasure still, to see and talk to you. I suppose the fox chase was quite an exciting affair for the people of Peal and other towns. But I fear the next report I hear of it will be that the crowd all stayed at Pearl the most of the night and got drunk and had a general tear up. That is what I expect to hear in next report. Yes - if Johnie had sen there he would also have been in the five and I think Nettie would have been too, if she had been there. Does Joe try to go with anybody? When I was at home the girls (Lizzie and Maggie) said he had been going some with May Hess. But I never seen them together while I was there. That is too bad that Matt Mulligan was so unfortunate as to loose his position as night watch by that explosion. I suppose he can not get a job at the grocery store any more at all. Well I am surprised to hear of Sell Strunk's break, as I was in hopes Sell would change his ways after George's death and after his joining the church but it seems he has failed. Well now I will close. John has just returned from the office and I did not get a letter from Maggie. Write soon.
Yours Lovingly,
Nettie&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>From: Jeanette Knox Chandler</category><category>Letter</category><category>To: Elijah H.

Dear Lize,
Your most welcome letter received and contents perused with pleasure. I suppose you will not find this letter very interesting and am at a lose to know or think of anything to write at a lll. So if you find it very dry, please excuse for this time and perhaps I can do better next time. I have been doing lots of running around the past two or three days. Last Monday I spent the day with Miss Mary Hicks and yesterday I was working on fancy work all day at the milliner shop and today will go again. So you see I am making up for when I had to stay at home. Monday while I was at Miss Hick's the Dr. came up to see how I was getting along and low and behold I was visiting. I guess he thought I was a rather pert patient. Don't you think so too? yes, I guess Willie is pretty tired of Pearl by this time but Pa said in one of his letters to me that he was going to try to get Willie to stay the balance of the winter there at home. But I fear he will not succeed for I think Willie would nearly die to stay there and have nothing to do. That was too bad about that poor man that had his legs cut off and I think it was a good thing that death did claim him as he always would have been such a bad cripple. Do you know what his name is? This is a lovely day and so pleasant. There is a splendid sleighing snow on the ground and the sleigh just more than fly. Where does Scrooge work about? I suppose Joe thinks he is competent to be Opr. Agent and all in one. Will he get a job and if so, where? I think the different R.R. Co's were very good to remember you so kindly by sending you such presents as you named in you letter. Well I would like to have seen Lizzie and Maggie when their sleigh broke down. I know I would have laughed. Has Pa got a sleigh or who's do they use. Well I must now close and go up town to my work. Good-bye with my love to you.
I am ever yours,
Nettie
(I would like to talk to you 2 or 3 days_

Dear Lige,
Your most welcome letter received yesterday and contents read with pleasure as it had been a long time it seemed to me since I had heard from you.
It took my letter of the 1st longer time to reach you than usual. I wrote you another before that one dated December 29th I believe. It surely did not reach you as you said you had been looking for a letter from me for 2 or 3 days. and I did not get any answer to it. I need your telegram today about 1/2 past 3 o'clock. I am sorry you were so uneasy about me but I appreciate your kindness to me more  than I can express. I did not answer your telegram as I am sure Maggie received a letter from me today and it will say how I am and knowing they would let you know I thought it no use to answer the telegram as the letter will be there sooner than it anyway. I am now about all right with the exception of a very  severe cold. My eyes are now all right except  a little weak yet. My face is clear of the breaking - out, but there is some signs of it still on my hands. I have not been, to say, sick at all only while my eyes were so very sore I kept to my bed most of 2 or 3 days. I have not been out of doors this past week but I expect to go up town tomorrow if the day is not stormy. I was so frightened when the Express Agent brought me the telegram today I could scarcely open it. I thought so of you were very sick and perhaps it was calling me home. Oh! how glad I would be to be there. I would give anything to see you but now it is a little over 2 months to wait until that time comes. I am so glad to have your picture when I get to thinking of you I can get your pictures and look at it, if I can't see you personally. I look at it 5 or 6 times a day. I see you still have that pin with "N"  on it. It looms up in the picture. Every time I show it to anyone here they notice the pin and ask me if it is mine. I tell them it used to be. Johnnie and some more of the town boys have been sawing ice. They are not done yet. I tell you we have to get up a little earlier while he is at work. But today being Sunday we did not have to get up so early. While we were at our breakfast, Johnnie said we were eating our dinner and I asked him why he said that. He said it was just twelve o'clock (noon) and I did not believe it and left the table to look at the clock, and sure enough it was 12-5. Wasn't we early? Do you ever get up so early?
Oh! Oh! Mister! You think you would treat me the same as the other girls if I was there. Do you? Well now I guess you wouldn't, I have something to say about that. I could not help but laugh when I read in your letter about you falling on the platform. It would have been a picnic for Lizzie and Maggie if they had seen you about that time. I am sorry to hear of Willie's misfortune but I had heard of it before. I suppose he will never find his pocket book not hear anything of it again. Oh! Yes - I suppose Frank Williams has Frank Woods done up. It would not surprise me very much if William and Lizzie marry. Pa said in one of his letters that they was afraid Williams would cause them to offer up another girl before the winter is over.
What do you think about it? Say tell Lizzie J. For me that I am just as Mad as I can be at her because she has not answered my letter.
I would like to have seen the show you told me about (The Man and Bear) I think I should have enjoyed it ever so much. Oh! I do hope they will succeed in getting the money to build the church with. That would be so nice. I can hardly write as I am using my knee for a writing desk. You will please excuse writing and lead pencil. Now I will close as it is bedtime. Oh! I forgot to tell you that I got my hair combed New Year's day but I expect if you have been here you could have did a better job of it. I did not style up one but today if it is true. I am getting old fast but I am yours,

Dear Lige: -
You're most welcome letter received yesterday eve late. I was very glad to hear from you again and to heat of you all begin well as this leaves us all at present. Oh! I know you all had a better time there, Christmas than I did here, I think the tree must have looked awful pretty and I only wish I could have gazed upon it. Oh! I am so tired of staying here and last night after I had retired I was thinking of home and nearly made up my mind that I would write you today to say that I would start for home soon and you could write and tell me where you would meet me, but this morn I thought I would stay a while longer anyway. I would hate to leave Johnnie, and especially as he has not found anything to do, he would be so home-sick if I would go home and Willie gone to. I don't know when Johnnie does intend to go home. I have not heard him say anything about it only to wish he was there. I think Maggie's got an awful nice present, also Ma, from the tree. Yours is quite nice also. Who was so thoughtful as to put those on for you? Do you know, I received another present since I wrote you your last. Mr. Hill sent me a large breast pin and a note asking me to accept of it with his best wishes. It is real pretty I think.
I hope you and Maggie has received your presents before this and I hope your cup or saucer was not broken when it reached you. Lige please excuse this short and poorly written letter as I will have to hurry to get it in the Riverton mail now and I am going to call at the doctor's office to have him to do some thing for my face and hands. There is some kind breakout on them and I sure am uneasy about it. Hoping to hear from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am yours,
Nettie

Dear Lige,
Your letter dated 9th received today. I wrote you this morning and took my letter up town to mail it and where the PM handed me my mail. There was a letter from you and I was most truly glad to get it. Was sorry to hear that you was feeling badly but hope you are all right ere this. How about that bridge falling down. Was it the bridge across the river that you had reference too. If so was there anyone hurt. Oh dear! I do think that Bill Shea is the meanest man that ever stepped. Mattie ought to be very proud of her nice husband. I hope Shea and Sink will both get that they deserve and I hope this will bust them as high as a kite. I think that is a nice report and get out about Bull Shea playing poker in our house for money. I know it is not time but it is time he with some of the other boarders played cards but only for fun. I do not know anything about Pa selling whisky on Sundays. I cannot say that it is not so nor I will not say that it is so but I do hope and trust that he has not stooped so low as that. If he has, it was for that Old Schestein but I would hate to think of it being time. I do wish some one would just beat Shae into a jelly as he deserves when he does as he did to Martin Whalin.
Annie and children has retired  good while ago but I thought I would stay up and write you a little in answer to this letter. Of course I have not much to write now as I wrote all I could think of this morning but I thought I would write a line or two to let you know I received your letter and I knew if I went off tomorrow that I could not write then so I would stay up a while tonight. I have written a long letter to Maggie tonight also.
Oh Lige I would like so well to see you but wouldn't I talk. Why I would talk so much my tongue would be sure but Say- you don't want to be writing me the way you have been tipping your hat at other girls for I am awful jealous. Did you know it? I was awful jealous of Annie and you because of the flirtation you two kept up all the time we were there. Ha! Ha! I'll tell Annie about this tomorrow. Every time any one comes and asks me if I am getting homesick because I can answer Lucy does for me. She always says "Yes- she is homesick to see her fellow - Lige Chandler. He said he was going to keep me but I was not big enough to stay." That is the answer she makes to any body.
Well I did not think I could near fill up this sheet of paper when I commenced to write but I have did so and have no said anything much for foolishness. Write soon.
Yours,

&lt;p&gt;From: Jeanette Knox Chandler, To: Elijah H. Chandler
Mailed From: Sidney, Iowa on October 18th, 1886&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidney, Ia Oct 18th 1886
Mr. E.H. Chandler
my Dearest Friend,
Your most welcome letter received 16th (Sat.) and contents perused with great pleasure and now I will make an attempt to scribble a few lines in ans. I would have written yesterday (Sun.) only Will and Erin Kidd was here and spent the greater portion of he day. Anyway, I could not have sent it out from here until today had I written yesterday. I know it is of no use for me to try to write you the good long letter you wrote me. That I will do the best I can. I always long for your letters to come for you tell me more news about home than the home letters I get. Maggie is real good to write long letters. I got one from her the same day I got yours. It was such a large one she had to pay extra postage on it. She wrote me 1 and 1/2 sheet of Fools cap paper and another little piece besides and then with your goo long letter, I got plenty of news that day. On the day before I received yours I received two letters. One from Pa and the other from Johnnie. I think you all are awful good to write to me and I do love to get letters from home. I am writing on the paper you sent me. This is the first I have used of it.
I think it is too bad that you have to work so long over your time and have to miss church too. But one good thing is-it is not very often they keep you that way. I suppose it did seem rather lonely without Maggie or I either. But now Maggie has returned and I guess keeps you all plenty of company telling all she seen and heard while at the fair. Well she is better off than I for she has been to St. Louis now twice and I have never been there. I expect she had a grand time from what she said in her letter to me.
Well I suppose Army Lakin is well satisfied now that she is married again. I do not know her husband at all. What kind of a man is he- He must have some money or they could not afford to board.
&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5;"&gt;Well Pearl is losing some of her citizens. Bill Stewart and Whit Brown. Well I must say I don't think Whit will be much of a loss. Do you think so? I suppose you will find it rather lonely without Stewart as you two are together very much. So Mrs. Lannery and sister are visiting in Pearl.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5;"&gt;I am acquainted with Mrs. Lannery but not her sister. I have never seen her. Is Mr. Lannery and children there also?
&lt;/span&gt;Oh yes - you had good reason for thinking of the last Saturday evening I spent in Pearl when with Billie Miller. Well I often think of our slopping place on the R.R. too. One time especially I think of very often. That time when Miss Boulton was our main subject and when I wished that I had stayed in Sidney so often also the night that I thought some one was under the bridge. Do you remember? Lige I do believe you. Don't say you think I do but make up your mind to say- you know I do. I do not know what month would be best at present but think it could be either the month of May or June which ever one would be preferable. Of course we may change our minds as to the time but now I think perhaps it could be there. I must say that I think Mr. Hess and Miss Frazier make themselves very busy about Miss Bartton. But Lizzie always did talk for Miss Button. I will tell you lots of things some day that she told me. I do not know how it is. Has Hattie come to Pearl yet. I suppose she surely is coming or at least mentioned it or Lizzie would not have been to the train. Oh my! Jed Frazier is at his old trade again. Well now I suppose he will gain in flesh again as he worked so hard over the river he was not one bit well or at least that is what Mr. Frazier said. It will be as Johnnie says I guess. Lizzie will begin to dress again. She always could dress better if Mr. Frazier  was staying in some saloon than any other time.
&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5;"&gt;Well I will close for this time hoping to hear from you soon.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5;"&gt;Annie sends her kindest regards to you.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5;"&gt;Oh yes! You ought to see Boss his Papa brought him a new suit of clothes from Reol Oak Saturday eve. He looks awful cute with them on. He looks much larger with them on than he does with dresses. And he feels and says he is just like Papa. This time I will close.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am yours lovingly
