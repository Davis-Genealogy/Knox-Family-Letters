Mailed From: Sanderson on May 31, 1917</p>
<p>Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
I received three letters from papa and one from mama,enclosing Lorin's and was sure tickled to get them. First mail I had received since leaving Valentine. Sure was too bad about that cyclone. Hope no more of them come along through here. Glad that one didnt hit Pearl. From looks of things I'm going to be here for couple months unless they send a man to relieve me and let me come to El Paso. I got all the clippings Papa sent. Wouldn't mind being with Pershings expedition if could get a good job. I went over to court house this PM and registered before County Clerk and Mailed it to registrar Pearl, care Sheriff Pittsfield. That way clerk said to address it. I enclosed stamped envelope so he could mail me a receipt. I must be there by the 5th. Should reach there in plenty of time. Golly its sure hot down here. Temperature of 110. Wish I was home. I couldn't quit very well now if I wanted to account them being so short of operators and couldn't get relief. This is a very large place. Like it better than Valentine though. It pays 7.50 more on the month. Is Aunt Sarah feeling OK? Hope so. She always was so good to me. Suppose Knox has stumped his toes a dozen times or so. Does he wash his feet before he goes to bed? Hope Lorin gets the job he mentioned. Gee wish I could see that kid of Grace's. I'll bet she is some baby. Have any of you been fishing this season yet? I'd like to be there and go squirrel hunting with Papa this season. Golly wish I was home. I only have one dispatcher to work with here. Get along fine with him. I saw him at Del Rio while back. Seems to be a nice man. Sure are a good bunch dispatchers and chiefs at El Paso. They all treat me good there and would show me about different wires and how to adjust a quad.
I worked on a quad most of time I was there. I'd be sending to Houston and Houston would be sending to Opr on other side of me all at same time on same wire. Kinda funny how it works but it does. Four men can work on the same wire, two sending and two receiving. Sure had lots messages. Run about 700 with Houston each day but I didn't have to do very much. Just about 4 hours steady work with Houston and two hours with Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Well don't know anything more to write. Sure glad to get that bunch of letters today. Mama hope you write again pretty soon. Papa averages a letter nearly every day and by golly they sure look good.
Hope everybody is well. Hope Vinnie gets well OK.
Love to all,
Martin</p>
<p>On Back:
I thot Papa had sent this but I thot you'd like to have it tho a little old.</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Got her evening of 7th. This sure is some town. One store and 2 or 3 restaurants. Not a very heavy job. Pays $87.50 and commissions all told ought to make it pay 100 but I'll only be here two or three days longer at least. I can stand on platform and throw across the Rio Grande into Old Mexico. Only about a hundred yards to River. Saw a whole bunch of Mexicans over there yesterday. Don't know what they were doing. I telegraph from 9 am to 3 pm. Express Commission ran $8.00 last month. Ha. He said it was a very poor month. Don't have very much to do. Have oil tanks here and have to contend with that but its nothing like Valentine. I kinda wish he hadn't out me on Valentine agency cause now I'll have to be running around working relief agencies and can't stay on my regular job and its more expensive to be running around here and there.
Do hope Margaret Â is well. Awful glad to hear Lucerne made her grades. How did Knox make it? Too bad Margaret couldn't take examination. Did I mention receiving Papas and Mamas letters enclosing Bess'? Anyway I did and mighty glad to get them. Haven't heard anything from Cra yet but expect to in few days. Don't suppose IÂ could get a pass up there anyway. I got a letter from MK 2 and they said they would be glad to furnish me pass San Antonio to St. Louis provided it was ok with me that they notify this road they had issuedÂ such transportation as required by I.C.C. Upon inquiry I found out that if I get pass from MK 2 that the RHASA will blacklist me from their road. They don't allow their employees to write for their own passes without taking up with them so that knocks me out of pass cause I don't want to have a bad record here. I don't see why in the dickens they should care who I get pass from. Guess if they wont furnish transportation I'll ride the cabooses. Wouldn't take me very long to get there. Sure will be glad when this war is over.
I'm going to work in Western Union this summer sure. It's good for $125.00 anytime. They have established an 8 hour day and overtime on Sundays now. That makes W.U. pretty good.
Well must stop and Get busy.
Better write me at Valentine. Expect to be back there by time you get this but if go someplace else can have my mail forwarded.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received Papa's dandy letter today. Sure good to see them come so often. Hope Ralph straightens out and gives good services. I'd hate to see him get discharged. I may write JLM pretty soon and see what he can offer. Wouldn't mind coming up to Coa if could get enough work. Think I'll come anyway. If he will put me to work and then go to work in Western Union first time I get a chance. I'll let you know what he says soon as I had from him. I'm getting pretty tired of this country. Easy job but don't like the climate.
Golly prices are sure high. Darn food trusts. It's just a drought. I'll bet theres no good reason at all for such exorbitant prices. They just use the war as an excuse.
How's Knox getting along. Knox why the Dicken's don't you write once in awhile.
Hope Margaret is well by now. Glad she didn't get Diphtheria. I wrote Sam a letter other day. Guess he will be kinda surprised to get it. Don't seem possible you are having so much rain there. Been wanting a rain here for last 4 months. I can't remember when it has rained here. Everything dry as a chip. has Grace gone to Louisville yet? Gee I'd love to see Audrey.Is Lorin still selling Oliver's?
Well i don't know much to write.
Hope to see you all before many days.
Lovingly,
Martin
P.S. Just wrote J.L.M. for a job. Let you know what he says soon as I hear from him.</p>

Received Papa's letter yesterday telling about passage of Conscription law and glad to get it. Guess I'll stay with the job for a while but I'll be darned if I wouldn't like to come home for a while. if I thought there was any chance of having to go to war I'd go join Navy right now cause I'd rather be in navy than in army. Gee they're sure billing out lots of stock here. Glad I'm off this agency. Got a letter from bess other day. Guess I'll answer it tonight. Have plenty of time on this job now. Business pretty light.
Gee it's warm here at night now. They say mosquitoes are awful bad here in summer. Golly I'll be it gets awful hot here in summer.
How's Coa fixed for operations now? Wouldn't mind having a relay job up there.
Maybe I'll write J.L.M. for a job. I don't like this County a bit. It's too windy.
Well I don't know a thing to write so will stop. Hope everybody is OK.

<p>Dear Little Sister,
I'm sending you your Christmas gift. Hope it fits this time. I think it is real pretty.
Grace has written Mamma a letter which I'm mailing. I'm at the P.O. and just got mom's letter and the magazine. Haven't read letter yet. Write soon. You write such nice letters.

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all;
Received 2 letters from Papa today. One via valentine and I was glad to get them both. Didn't think you'd be able to get one to St. Blanca so quick. Nothing new to write. Getting along O.K. I called up both last night and asked them what they wanted me to do in case one called while I was working with other and they said just use my own judgement and if I pay no attention to them they get sore. I'm hitting the ball here pretty lively. Keep busy every minute of the night. The depoÂ I trick open copied a 19 for a IP 2/5 train this pm to meet another IP No. 2 train at Fort Hancock. No. 2 got to Fort Hancock and waited 2 hours for the 2nd 5 to show up but they didn't so he called up Dispr. on phone and went on. 2nd No. 5 was in a blind siding down the line. They claimed they didn't get the order. Disp. came after open about it and open looked for his clearance and he had it non clearance so it will be up to the train creed.
Well, must stop. Will write again soon.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>
<p>1/10 - 9 am.
Got Papas letter this am. Sure glad to get them so after Papa, to get this job course all the openers thought they had to handle baggage and wouldn't bid on it. They have a night help on now so it isn't so much of a roast as it used to be.
Will write,
Martin</p>

Dearest Folks,
Thought I'd write few lines tonight while have time but can't tell you much except that I'm feeling OK and had a pleasant voyage.
It's pretty cold here but not any worse than New Jersey.
Am not allowed to mention hardly anything so don' expect to learn anything about the war from me.
Rode on an English train other night. They're a great deal different from ours. They are built in compartments. Each compartment sealing 8 men (3rd class). No way of getting from one compartment to another except by getting off and entering another. Just like traveling in a carriage.
Had a good stateroom on the steamer and didn't get a bit seasick.
I'll write you again in few days and don't worry if you don't hear from me regularly. Hope you are all well-
Lots Love
Martin

<p>Monday 8th '17
Dearest Folks
Will try to write you a few lines this am. Was so glad to hear from Mama yesterday. Doesn't matter to whom they are addressed, just so I get them.
Am feeling much better, one breast is still swelled, and I have the night sweats and a breaking out on my body caused from fever, But I am getting stronger every day now. Mrs. Kelley left Saturday P.M. and I bathed the baby yesterday and this morning. She is doing fine and everyone was out yesterday afternoon, then Mr. and Mrs. Geo Maxon and son wee out last night. Guess we'll keep having company, as so many have told Lorin they're so anxious to see the baby. He's going to try and get some pictures of her this noon.
Thanks to Grandma Chandler, she has another silver dollar to add to her savings. Don't think she should have done it, but we appreciate it. Lorin took her little bank up to the bank this A.M. He adds something every day I think. Mrs. Klingner and Mella were out after you left Mama and brought her a little solid gold hand ring.
The material Ruby has for her coat is so pretty and I'm sure proud of it.
Guess you'd be surprised, as we were shocked to hear Mr. Bartlett the Wabash agent here, committed suicide in the depot on Friday. No reason has been assigned to his rash act, but an auditor came in to check him up and a dray man testified at the coroners inquest that he had heard them arguing over some freight bills. Some additions that had been added to Paddock Lumber Co.'s bills. But other people think it was family affairs. Will send you the clippings from the papers if I can find them. He was the agent here for 7 years. It certainly was a shock to everyone as they were supposed to have been the happiest of families.
Am so glad to have Ruby here. She is so good to me, but I'll tell you I missed Mama and so did Mrs. Kelley. She spoke of you so often. Bess was so sleepy after talking all night that she layer down and slept in the afternoon and I had a lump in my throat all day. Ruby had spells over the "offspring" when she arrived and has never quite gotten over her yet. Wish everyone of you could see her.
Lorin is going to be in a minstrel show tomorrow night in Taylorville , some fellows pulled out at the last minute and they asked Lorin to take one place. He's to be an end man and has a prominent part. He's studying his song "Are you from Dixie" and his gags. Either Bess or Ruby will go to Taylorville and see it.
Wonder what causes Mama to get so dizzy? Mrs. Kelley had those kind of spells.
Yes, we let Mrs. Wilson know you had gone. She was called to St. Louis on Friday to take care of her niece, a trained nurse, who has pneumonia and expects will be gone for some time.
Mrs. Peuce (your advisor Mama) is also very ill with pneumonia. They have a trained nurse to care for her. Other box from fathers came after such a time. He sent the baby a powder puff, me a small picture of mother and a baby, a towel, and a box of stationary, and a lot of Christmas candy. Was nice of him to remember us. He sent each member of his family something. We heard from mother , three miners and she have taken more cold and was having lots to do.
Bess and Lorin went to Bartlett's funeral. It as held at the house hey said. There were oceans of flowers.
Will be glad to get Lucerne's drawings . Was so sorry to her Mary school her, but its all over now and it didn't hurt anyway did it Lucerne?
When little Jack was here, he went over to Waggners and told them we had a dog. They said "what kind of dog is it?" he said he didn't know. They asked if it was a bird do. He said, "No! This dog don't fly!" Ha.
Mrs. Waggner and Gladys came over the next day after you left. We have had lots of company.
Lorin just called up from town and said I had letters from home, but he had to go to Taylorvillle and won't be back until night. Said he'd send the letters down to the school house to Bess and I'll get them about 4 pm. I want to send this up by Bess this noon so I'll close for this time as she's ready to do back.
Love to Everybody,
Grace</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all,
Got in here last night and went to work. Job is enough to keep a man busy but not so awful hard. Have a night helper to handle baggage, etc. So I don't have to do anything but telegraphy and clear trains on Both TP na dishes. I'm plumb disgusted with board here. This place is about the size of Hillview and only one place in town to board and they sure treat a fellow awful. Have to carry wash hater to your room and no carpet and just about the poorest accommodations a man could find. Got 1 pork chap, 2 biscuits and a few friend potatoes for breakfast and thats all. I got up from the table hungry. Charge 30.00 month. I went to bed right after breakfast this morning and got up at exactly 10 minutes after seven and they told me I was too late for supper. Had to go buy a meal at Brown's News. They know they have a fellow cinched and they don't care how they treat them. I asked how much for just a room and they said just the same as for board and room. Now what do you think of that? I was figuring on getting my meals at restaurant but they queered that. It's just plain hold up. They know you can't get any place else to stay.
If I stay here I'm sure going to get the Co to give me a box car or else build some kind of shanty and go to Baching. Can't possibly get by for less than 35 to 40 a month for board the way it is now. If I get up after supper time I have to buy a meal and its hard to arrange sleep so can get breakfast and supper both cause I generally sleep 10 hours. Here I never eat more than 2 meals a day and they wont give me one of those if I happen to be late but they charge for it. Just the same - I told the manager what I thought abut it and he informed me I had the privilege of going some place else to board if I didn't like it, which of course he knew I couldn't get any place else. I'm going to every house intern tomorrow and see if I can't get a room.
Job pays 85 don't get the 5.00 for handling mail as the night helper does that.
Have lots trains to clear. Just twice as many as at Valentine cause here we get the Tp. trains too but don't mind it as long as don't have to handle baggage and mail.
Pretty cool here. They say they have cold winters here.
Well its now 11:45 s will stop and get things lined up to go to work. Work from 12 to 8.
Love to all,
Martin</p>

Dearest Mama, Papa, and all
I've just gotten cleaned up and thought I had better write. We had intended to go to Taylorville to a football game but something was the matter with the car. I did want to go so bad, but I'm going to Jane Carrie's house to see about a party the Glee Club is to give Thursday night.
I got along all OK with my recitation. I've had so many compliments on it. Nearly every time I'd see anyone who was there, they'd tell me how well I did.
You know I told you that some Taylorville Ladies came down and organized a Hilson Ladie's Club. Well Mrs. Pence was appointed as a committee of one to arrange for a Glee Club. She asked me and six other girls and we sang here, at Harvel, and at Taylorville. Our songs were real cute. We had one to the tun of My Little Girl - Oh Mr. Hughes you're stock are dropping
You are losing notes each day
Oh Mr. Hughes we hear you're knocking
Tho you're many miles away
We read your talks in all the papers
What you've promised not to do
Oh Mr. Hughes we know you're lonely
But we can not note for you
We had lots of other ones too and some Wilson yells. While we were at marvel a man gave us five dollars, so were going to have a party on it. We get to invite "our company" - Don't know who to invite. The ladies of Tayloville treated us so nice and altogether we've had lots of fun. We'll know Tuesday who is to be our president.
I got my coat while I was at Taylorville. It's brown velour. I did want a plush with brown fur trimming but they were too expensive.
Hope I get to come home Thanksgiving but guess I wont if I don't get a pass because my fare would be nearly six dollars. I'll sure be home Xmas tho' and get to stay from Dec 22 to Jan.
Hope you are all well - I'm getting along fine at school. We had a program in my room day before yesterday. It was real good. The girls asked me to sin so I sang Little Gray Home in the West. We had company, too.
Lorin has just offered Grace and I $0.15 each if we read something against Wilson in the Republican news paper. You couldn't pick up a republican news paper without reading something against Wilson. In fact that's about all it contains.
I'm enclosing a five with which I want to pay my lodge dues for the past four or five months. Guess it wont come amiss if everything is as high as it is here. Flour is $3.00 a sack. You never did say whether or not you got the other $5.00 (which I borrowed to buy shoes in Springfield) I returned but I guess you did because you got the letter. I've got all of my debts paid now, Pearl Store, my board, Donohoo's, Ruby, and you. I wrote to Mrs. Moultrie too - All I owe, now is a letter to Ruby and I'll try to write it soon. Martin never did answer my letter. When you write tell him I'm looking for one. Lot's of Love,
Bess</p>
