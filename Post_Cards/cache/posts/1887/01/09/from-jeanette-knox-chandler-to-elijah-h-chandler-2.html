Sunday Eve.
Mr. E. H. Chandler
Dear Lige,
Your most welcome letter received yesterday and contents read with pleasure as it had been a long time it seemed to me since I had heard from you.
It took my letter of the 1st longer time to reach you than usual. I wrote you another before that one dated December 29th I believe. It surely did not reach you as you said you had been looking for a letter from me for 2 or 3 days. and I did not get any answer to it. I need your telegram today about 1/2 past 3 o'clock. I am sorry you were so uneasy about me but I appreciate your kindness to me more  than I can express. I did not answer your telegram as I am sure Maggie received a letter from me today and it will say how I am and knowing they would let you know I thought it no use to answer the telegram as the letter will be there sooner than it anyway. I am now about all right with the exception of a very  severe cold. My eyes are now all right except  a little weak yet. My face is clear of the breaking - out, but there is some signs of it still on my hands. I have not been, to say, sick at all only while my eyes were so very sore I kept to my bed most of 2 or 3 days. I have not been out of doors this past week but I expect to go up town tomorrow if the day is not stormy. I was so frightened when the Express Agent brought me the telegram today I could scarcely open it. I thought so of you were very sick and perhaps it was calling me home. Oh! how glad I would be to be there. I would give anything to see you but now it is a little over 2 months to wait until that time comes. I am so glad to have your picture when I get to thinking of you I can get your pictures and look at it, if I can't see you personally. I look at it 5 or 6 times a day. I see you still have that pin with "N"  on it. It looms up in the picture. Every time I show it to anyone here they notice the pin and ask me if it is mine. I tell them it used to be. Johnnie and some more of the town boys have been sawing ice. They are not done yet. I tell you we have to get up a little earlier while he is at work. But today being Sunday we did not have to get up so early. While we were at our breakfast, Johnnie said we were eating our dinner and I asked him why he said that. He said it was just twelve o'clock (noon) and I did not believe it and left the table to look at the clock, and sure enough it was 12-5. Wasn't we early? Do you ever get up so early?
Oh! Oh! Mister! You think you would treat me the same as the other girls if I was there. Do you? Well now I guess you wouldn't, I have something to say about that. I could not help but laugh when I read in your letter about you falling on the platform. It would have been a picnic for Lizzie and Maggie if they had seen you about that time. I am sorry to hear of Willie's misfortune but I had heard of it before. I suppose he will never find his pocket book not hear anything of it again. Oh! Yes - I suppose Frank Williams has Frank Woods done up. It would not surprise me very much if William and Lizzie marry. Pa said in one of his letters that they was afraid Williams would cause them to offer up another girl before the winter is over.
What do you think about it? Say tell Lizzie J. For me that I am just as Mad as I can be at her because she has not answered my letter.
I would like to have seen the show you told me about (The Man and Bear) I think I should have enjoyed it ever so much. Oh! I do hope they will succeed in getting the money to build the church with. That would be so nice. I can hardly write as I am using my knee for a writing desk. You will please excuse writing and lead pencil. Now I will close as it is bedtime. Oh! I forgot to tell you that I got my hair combed New Year's day but I expect if you have been here you could have did a better job of it. I did not style up one but today if it is true. I am getting old fast but I am yours,
Nettie</body></html></p>
