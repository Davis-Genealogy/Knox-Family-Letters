Dear Sister and Family,
It may be of interest to let you know of the death last night of Mrs. Ethal Whitesideler. We had Doctor Nosbry of Springfield to see her early of week. Her home is a paradise, they have everything of the very best in the home that anyone could wish for. Simply wonderful to see some of the rooms, how magnificently they are furnished. Russell said he saw Loren and Grace for a few moments, they had stopped at a garage to get some air. Russell's one of a class of 28 to graduate from N.H.H.S. Commencement tonight at Frenless Theatre, there are 5 numbers inÂ the program by members of the class. He will appear in two of them, in voice, solo, and in a quartette (boys). We expect Lucille and Braus Ford this afternoon. They were much in evidence at the H.S. Commencement. Lucille was to sing, he to make the address. We will expect Grace and Loren to stop in their return.
Your Bro,
W.T.K.</body></html></p>
