My Dear Wife
I will write you this morning. This is the first chance I have had to write any. I got here in the after part of last night. Am well and I trust this will find all of you well. I am awful anxious to hear from you but I can not say yet whether I will get to go to Prescalt or not. This being Sunday I have no chance to see any one so I can find out whether they will grant me a pass or not. This is a nice city and the people are very sociable. I am tired from riding on the cars. Did not get to sleep very much until this morning went to bed about three o'clock and sleep till eight. I saw some nice country coming down here and some very rough. It rained from the time I left K City Friday morning until some time in the night and then commenced S. morning and snowed until yesterday evening. There is some snow on the ground here and the mountains are wet with snow. The snow was 14 inches deep in Colorado and I thought some time the train would stop they went so slow. I can't hardly describe how it looked going up the mountains. The train had two heavy engines and they did not go as fast as a man could walk. I will not try to give any further description of the country but will tell you when I come home. If I don't get passed over the A &amp; P I will not go to Prescalt. If I do get them I will telegraph to you so you can write to me. Everything here is high and I can't afford to fool away money trying to dead head my way with train men. I would give any thing if I was with you and the children now. Kiss the children for me. Tell Vinnie I think of her too. I have written to you each morning since I left. I hope you are enjoying your self. I will close and write to you again tomorrow but not until often I find out what I am going to do. I will have to stay here tonight I guess.
Good bye,
From your Loving Husband,
E.H. Chandler</body></html></p>
