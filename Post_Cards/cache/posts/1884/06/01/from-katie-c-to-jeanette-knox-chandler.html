Dear Friend,
I thought I would write you a few lines for I have not forgotten you but I expect that you have forgot me ere this. I have waited for you to write for so long, we are all well as common except Pa he is suffering with the tenalgia. Do you have much enjoyment? Now a days I have a very good time considering I live in the country. We live three miles from Mesquite but I have a good riding horse and I get on him of a Sunday and it does not take me long to go to church and Sunday school. There are a great many young folks here and I like them all so well, we have a splendid Sunday school. The average attendance is 100. We are going to have a picnic on the 28th of this month I anticipate on having a splendid time. We have an organ in the church. Manda preforms for them, Eustace and Manda live in Mesquite now. Eustace has a lumber yard there. There is a singing teacher coming out from Dallas to teach a class. There are 42 in the class. I am going to attend. His wife teaches music I expect to take music lessons also. I wish you were here to go with me. Give my love to Ella and tell her to write to me. Please tell me her post office address so I can write to her whether she will write me or not. Give my love to Maggie, tell her I would love to see her, I often think of our good old school days and the romps we used to have to get her. Would love to call them back for awhile were it possible. Please excuse my poorly written letter for I am writing at night while siting up with Pa. With love to the family and a better portion to yourself. I remain a true friend.
Katie G.</body></html></p>
