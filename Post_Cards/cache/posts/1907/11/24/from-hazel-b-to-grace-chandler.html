<p>Dear Grace,
Why don't you write? I wrote you last. We had the best home talented show called Queen Tatiana's Enchanted Woods. I wrote and told Marie about t but didn't write you any. I wrote you last and asked you if you was coming up but you didn't have the care to answer. I can't come down during Thanksgiving on account of my schoolwork. Will you come with Laura? You had better.
Hazel B.</p>
