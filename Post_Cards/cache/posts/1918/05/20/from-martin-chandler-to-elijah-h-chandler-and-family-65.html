Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
No mail since last writing. Am still on same job, getting along OK. Nothing new to write except that it didn't rain yesterday or day before. Wrote Grace and Ruby other night and will write Lorin tonight. Certainly is getting warm over here.
We have moving picture shows at YMCA every night. Mostly French pictures. I've been unable to go account being on duty all the time.
Do you get the Kansas City papers? They quite frequently publish information concerning us that I'm not allowed to mention. At least they will tell you where I am.
They printed picture of our Captain and an article telling of him being awarded Croix La Guerra for distinguished action while under shell fire. That was some time ago.
Well how goes everything on the Ca? Hope you get the raise. Think we will be paid about tomorrow (Monday). Hope so anyway. We're still batching here as I mentioned before. Generally have pan cakes for breakfast each morning. I put half gallon sugar and some water on stove yesterday to make syrup for our cakes and one of other fellows thought it was water and put soap in it and washed dishes in it. Ha Ha never did know the difference until I told him. I noticed the dishes were all sticky and when I found out syrup was missing I knew right away what had happened. You see we use the pan to cook in, then wash the dishes in it andÂ then use it for shaving. Ha. We have one skillet and use it for frying, boiling, baking, and some times it serves as a plate to eat off of.
Well must close and go to work. Will write as often as can. Don't have much time to write. Want to write Lorin tonight if get a chance. You all keep on writing.
Lovingly,
Martin
