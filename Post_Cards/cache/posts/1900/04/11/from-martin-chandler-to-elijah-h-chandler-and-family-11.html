Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
No mail since last writing. Received letter from Bess today dated at Dunlap. Sure was glad to get it. That's letter number 3 received since being here. Nothing new to write, or rather, lots news to write but can't write it. Having lovely weather. Guess Aunt Anna and Ruby are there now. Bess said they were going to meet in K.C. and come to Pearl together.
I'd like to be there myself. Am still batching with other fellows. Like it fine. I'm on a Radio job here. Get Paris and Berlin press each day. Get about 1000 words from Paris relative military situation. German don't put out much news.
I'm getting fleshy on our own cooking. Most meals consist of Ouefs, Pomme de terries, Coffee, Bun de pain, and confiturerie.
You see I'm learning to cook in the French style-Ha. We only have 2 meals a day - one about 10:30 am and one about 5:00 pm. We 5 fellows sure have a great time. At least we enjoy ourselves as much as possible under the existing conditions. Lots singing, joking, etc. Might win myself a home with a little French girl if I could speak and understand French well enough. I get a smile once in a while and then when she starts talking I'm lost so then she gets peeved cause all her words were wasted. Sure is a great life. We have things fixed pretty nice in our radio station. Good bunks, etc.
Dad how goes everything on the "only way"? Did you all get a new schedule yet? They should get a raise by all means. We have a sergeant in charge of this station. Sure is a Prince besides a very efficient man. If I ever get a chance I'll have some pictures taken and send home. Intended doing it before leaving the states. Hows fishing around there? I haven't seen a fish for so long I've forgotten how they look. I've seen a few rabbits over here. Only game I've seen.
Well, must close and get supper. All of you write often.
Am feeling great. Hope you are all well.
Love,
Martin
