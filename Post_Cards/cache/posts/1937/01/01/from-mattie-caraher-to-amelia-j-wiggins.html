Dear Aunt Millie,
I read your pretty Christmas card and hope you are well. We are having lots of snow and ice. Expect you are having plenty cold weather up there. I hope you have a prosperous 1937 year. John is not able to work yet. His wrist is sore and stiff yet. He broke his wrist 3 month ago. It takes a long time to heal broken bones. Well Aunt Millie I was surprised other you are 85. I hope you have good health and hope you are not alone out there. You must take good care of yourself. So many people have colds and flu. I was in bed last week with a bad cold. Am feeling lots better now.
You wanted to know, John's full name is: John Benard Thomas Caraher.
When he was confirmed he took Thomas so you see he has 3 Saint's names.
Aunt Millie, we have told John that we are his foster parents over so don't ever mention it in your letters. We may tell him when he gets to be 21 but I don't want I'm to know yet so I know you wont mention it. Aunt Millie don;t you think you will ever get to come out here in Kansas. I expect it would be quite a big trip for me.
I haven't heard from Mabel since Christmas. They were all OK at that time.
Well Aunt Millie you write me when you can. I like to hear from you and hope you keep well.
So I will close for this time with
Love and Kisses
Lovingly your niece,
Mattie and John and Johnnie</p>
