My Dear Ruby:
Just now I heard the honk, honk of an auto in front of the door but just thought it was Lewis. Then I asked Lucerne to look out and see, and it was the Smarts of Milton come down  to meet May, and May was with him. She said Vinnie had sent her word to come at once as Lisa was so much worse. She asked for you and wanted you to go up with her. I wish you had been here, for it seems that none of us has been of any assistance to them. May then asked if I could jump in and go as you was not here, but of course I couldn't leave just now, and I feed so bad about it too. And Dr. is away in hospital too, and I guess that makes Lisa feel that there is no one to look out for him. I would liked to have heard how Uncle Jim is today. Mr. Johnson was asking me how he was, and said if it hadn't been for Aunt Sarah he wouldn't have been down there. I told him that was the place for him for there were so many of them all there and so good to take care of him. He said if he didn't change his mind he was going down there next Monday.
We washed today and I am tired out. Didn't get done till after noon. I hope Aunt Sarah is feeling all right. Annie did not say in her letter but I guess if there had been anything the matter with her, she would have mentioned it. I am making corn salad now just started on it about those little onions I wrote you about. I wouldn't get them if they are a big price. 40 per gallon is plenty to pay for them. I must stop now.
Love to all,
Mamma</p>
