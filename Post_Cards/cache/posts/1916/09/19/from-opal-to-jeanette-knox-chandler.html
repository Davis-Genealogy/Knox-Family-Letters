Dearest Net and all,
Just a few lines to tell you Grandpa is awful sick. Had the Dr. to him today. Grandma isn't feeling very well either. The Fall didn't put her in bed but made her feel bad. Grandpa told Bill he didn't think he could last long. The rest of us are all well. So glad you got to go to the fair. Bill is waiting for this to close.
As ever,
Opal</p>
