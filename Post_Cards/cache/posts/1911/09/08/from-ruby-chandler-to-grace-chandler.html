<p>Dearest Grace:
Won't you even send me a card? Did you get those from Carmen? We received Bess' letter after I mailed Papa's. Glad to low she is doing so well. We went all over to the new high school today. It is just great. We're so glad Martin is to tie those studies. Write soon.
Lovingly,
Ruby</body></html></p>
