My dear Ruby,
Are you paying me back for the way I treated you dear? Well I don't like it. I want to hear from you. Did you ever get my photo I sent to you before Christmas? I was afraid you had not, as I had not heard from you. How is everybody? Give my love to all the family. I was at Knox's last Sunday. They are all well. Am getting a little tired of school. Had a fine time in Decater and Urbana during holidays.
Love,
Pearl</body></html></p>
