Dear Sister,
If it is not to cold tomorrow you might come over, there is a little oyster supper given by the public school at the Hotel tomorrow night, but I don't think there will be many out, but we can attend anyhow. I can take you back Sunday.
Your Bro,
Will
I heard today of all of you being to Dodge's last evening.</body></html>
