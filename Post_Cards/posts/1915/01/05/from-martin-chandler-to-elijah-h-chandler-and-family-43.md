Dearest Folks,
Just arrived here this am. Pretty nice town. Haven't found anything yet. Will probably stay here 3 or 4 days and get my mail. If I do leave can have it forwarded . Sure is warm here. More so than in Houston. I'll probably go from here to Ft. Worth. Sure wish I had a job. Hope everybody is OK. Would like to be there but no chance. Ha. Will let you know for sure in day or 2 where am going.
