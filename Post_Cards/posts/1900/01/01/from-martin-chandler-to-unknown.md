Business not very heavy just now. Don't have very many freight trains. It's getting pretty cold here. Have heavy frosts every night but during day it warms up so don't need a fire. I get the Tribune regularly. Quite a but of surprising news. Didn't think Geo Bixby would get married. Don't see how he is going to support a wife.
How did Ralph make out over stopping no 11 other morning? Gee they sure are strict on this road. Keep the merit and demerit system up all the time. Its called the brown record of discipline. When you get 90 demerits they let you go and no excuses go. I've got 10 for dating a train order 8th month in August instead of writing "August" out in full. Guess I've got them worked off by now though. They make a fellow toe the mark all around. They've eternally got spotters and assistants out on the line watching for every little thing. You can't connect two words together in a train order not dt an "I" with a circle and all the words must be even distance apart. 2nd trick man here got 10 brownies account two words were too close together in a 19. They bring an order around some time and see if you have it on your file and if they don't find it they want tot know why you haven't filed copy of that order. Also send a man over road every month to examine all the operators on books of rules and time card. All the fellows say if you can work for the Southern Pacific you can work for any road in the country. It's not hard work though, or at least it isn't here. Don't have any block wires to contend with. If you haven't got anything for a train just give them the board. Don't ever give the rans here the board though cause we've got a standing slow order for trains in both directions.
Well guess I'll stop and get busy. Got quite a few expense bills tonight. Hows Knox coming? Hope to hear from you all soon.
Lovingly,
