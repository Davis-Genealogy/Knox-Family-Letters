From: Jesse, To:Â Margaret

Fri Eve 5:40 P.M.
At Home

Dearest One,
As I feel so lonely this P.M. thought I would write you as I haven't seen you for two or three evenings. That is to converse with you. Sorry it was so that we could not be together last eve. Trusting it will so be I could see you at Sunday School next Lord's day if not before, trust it will be before. Was up past the house last PM. But could not see you - yourself and your sister's family's my sincere heartfelt sympathy in your and their trouble. Trusting the little one will continue to get better. Sorry dear you thought I was mad the eve we were conversing at a distance I sure was not and Margaret I am more than willing to say please a thousand times for you and also do anything I can for to please you.Dearest I will be up by the house at 8 o'clock P.M. and if you can see me a moment would be a pleasure to me. But if not will wait til it is convenient. Trusting you will not think I have advanced a step that I had ought not to of done by writing this.
But dear when I do not get to see you regularly I am lost - I don't know what I will do when you go to the city.
Margaret - take good care of yourself and do not get sick - as I know you are worn out for you was up all night you must retire early this P.M. and get your regular rest.
Will Close
