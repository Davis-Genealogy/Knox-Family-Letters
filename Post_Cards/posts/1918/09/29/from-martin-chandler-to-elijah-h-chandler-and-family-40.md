Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received papa's letter day before yesterday and another today and also received mama's and Bess' dandy letters enclosing Johns and Aunt Anna's and I certainly enjoyed them all. Was mighty glad to get them. Was first mail I've received since leaving Ft. Bliss. Am over at club tonight. Was at YMCA Thursday and Friday nights. Had a social Thursday night. In fact they have on every Thursday. Good program. Served ice cream and cake. Friday night was formal opening and dedication of YMCA. Had good speaking and good program.  Enjoyed it very much. These sure are good places to pass away time at night. All kinds of amusements. Lots of good books, both at YMCA and Club. The people here are very hospitable and some notable financial powers live in immediate vicinity of this place. Wilsons son-in-law lives only four miles from here. Was glad to get Lesley Wildt's address. Have been wanting it for past year. He and I used to chum together quite a bit. Haven't located Lake Denmark yet but will do so tomorrow and if not very far will get to see him. It is now rumored that we sail about the 3rd of next month. But have heard nothing definite but think we will leave pretty soon. Just found out yesterday that I can have all or part of my pay sent home by government so I'll put in a $20.00 allotment to be sent home each month. Had to give name of some relative today who should be notified in case of my death or an accident. All preparations indicate we will leave shortly. They're not fixing up camp very much and wont build anything or order any stoves for us, and it's pretty cold here too, so i guess we will leave shortly. I have another horse now. It's a fine big black horse. Awful powerful and can run like the wind. It's a great pet too. Did you get the Battalion picture ok? You didn't mention it but suppose you did. I'll try and have my picture taken with horse before I leave and send to you. Awful glad the children are getting along OK in school and mighty glad Lucerne can play so well. Wish I could have been there when Sam and all the rest were at home. I'd like mighty welt see Audrey Grace. To think I've a close relative that I can't see and don't when when I can - I'll bet she is a cute kid. We had General Inspecting this morning. Had all out filled equipment laid out and cleaned up nicely. Also had pistol inspection. We all have 45 Caliber Colts automatics. Sure are good guns. Thats all the weapons we have. Don't stand much show if we should happen to be compelled to repair or construct line of communication under fire. Of course we wont fight any this winter. Will probably train all winter in France and be ready for spring. Lots of men leaving everyday now for France. Uncle Sam is gathering them over there pretty fast.
Golly I'll certainly appreciate the sweater the girls are knitting. It will come in mighty handy. Yes, mama I've heard the songs you mentioned. "Over There" and "America Here's my Boy." Thats about all they sing out here. They all like "Over There" best of all. Glad to hear Aunt Sarah received her back pension money. Sure hope she stays well and is feeling good. Golly papa I'd like o be there and help out with the work. I know what apple season is there. All the crops through Missouri and Kansas are best ever so the farmers said when we passed through there. Is Grimaly working at "Dr." Papa? Sure hope you learn to use that bug OK  cause its a great labor saver and you can do so much better with it after learning to use it. What branch of service is Wade Maynard in? Guess there will be quite a few go over before the war is over. Saw in paper yesterday where the Pope's peace proposal had failed and he predicts the war will last for 3 years yet. Gee everything is high out here. Bacon is 47 cents pound. Eggs 70 cents dozen. Our laundry in Fr. Bliss cost each man $1.75 per month. No matter how much or how little we sen but I sent min in to Long Branch other day and it cost me $1.59 so it will amount to quite a little in a month. Well must close . Everybody write often. If can do so will give you address soon as we get across.
Lovingly,
Martin</body></html>
