Dearest Papa, Mama, and all,
Received a letter from Papa yesterday and a long on today and was sure glad to get them. Gee they sure are doing some business back there. Think I told you in other letter I'd be here a month longer and possibly two. Glad to hear Ralph is back at work. I don't want to work on era very bad but I'd like awful well to be closer to home. Gee I wish I could see some of you . I sold a ticket to Waterburg Conn last night - $72.40- I didn't have any ticket on hand so I wired Sam Luis Abirro to send me one and gave him the routing and he sent it up all made out. Excursion tickets are on sale the year round. Every Friday and Saturday have reduced rates to nearly all the places along the line. Can get a ticket to Chicago and return for $65.00.
Sure have some powerful engines on this line. They're all oil burners. Haven't a coal burner on the line.
I stuck a first class passenger train 5 minutes yesterday morning account putting "9th" for "September" - They might give me 10 days for it - They're awful strict. They all say that if you can work for the S.P. you can work for any road in the country. They sure enforce their rules. I was in a hurry to make out the clearance as train was ready to leave and without thinking I put 9/20 instead of September 20 - That's OK on any other road but this one. It takes about 3 years to land a job on this road. But if extra work is good I think I'll stick. Of course I'd probably lay off and come home before 3 years. But these are pretty good jobs and I want to land something steady if I can. I don't have to fill lamps or lanterns or sweep out or handle baggage or anything like that. Have a baggage boy to do that. All stations have a baggage boy. All I have to do is sell tickets, copy orders, and put on mail. Sure copy a bunch of orders and seek quite a few tickets.
Well must stop. Hope to hear from you all soon-
I'll write more often
Lovingly,
Martin</body></html>
