Dear Girlie,
I don't know whether I can write like Mauele G. or not. I will mail this at Alton. I will be in Pearl Monday, if I get back in time, am going to Union tonight. Be a good girl and don't get put in jail, if you can help it.Â So long,
From E.M.
Excuse poor writing and must keep on going from writing this.</body></html>
