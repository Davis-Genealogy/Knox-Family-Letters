Miss Bess Chandler

Dear girlie,
Was so glad to get cards from all of you girls. I saw Orin P. today Bess. He was in Petersburg. I went to a funeral of an old boy friend today. I feel sort of blue tonight. Papa and Emma are sitting in the swing. They liked you girls so much. Write to me soon.
Sincerely,
Marie H.

This was the night that we serenaded Orin and met Miss Cummings.</body></html>
