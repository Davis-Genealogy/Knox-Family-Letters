Dearest Mama, Papa, and all
I've just gotten cleaned up and thought I had better write. We had intended to go to Taylorville to a football game but something was the matter with the car. I did want to go so bad, but I'm going to Jane Carrie's house to see about a party the Glee Club is to give Thursday night.
I got along all OK with my recitation. I've had so many compliments on it. Nearly every time I'd see anyone who was there, they'd tell me how well I did.
You know I told you that some Taylorville Ladies came down and organized a Hilson Ladie's Club. Well Mrs. Pence was appointed as a committee of one to arrange for a Glee Club. She asked me and six other girls and we sang here, at Harvel, and at Taylorville. Our songs were real cute. We had one to the tun of My Little Girl - Oh Mr. Hughes you're stock are dropping
You are losing notes each day
Oh Mr. Hughes we hear you're knocking
Tho you're many miles away
We read your talks in all the papers
What you've promised not to do
Oh Mr. Hughes we know you're lonely
But we can not note for you
We had lots of other ones too and some Wilson yells. While we were at marvel a man gave us five dollars, so were going to have a party on it. We get to invite "our company" - Don't know who to invite. The ladies of Tayloville treated us so nice and altogether we've had lots of fun. We'll know Tuesday who is to be our president.
I got my coat while I was at Taylorville. It's brown velour. I did want a plush with brown fur trimming but they were too expensive.
Hope I get to come home Thanksgiving but guess I wont if I don't get a pass because my fare would be nearly six dollars. I'll sure be home Xmas tho' and get to stay from Dec 22 to Jan.
Hope you are all well - I'm getting along fine at school. We had a program in my room day before yesterday. It was real good. The girls asked me to sin so I sang Little Gray Home in the West. We had company, too.
Lorin has just offered Grace and I $0.15 each if we read something against Wilson in the Republican news paper. You couldn't pick up a republican news paper without reading something against Wilson. In fact that's about all it contains.
I'm enclosing a five with which I want to pay my lodge dues for the past four or five months. Guess it wont come amiss if everything is as high as it is here. Flour is $3.00 a sack. You never did say whether or not you got the other $5.00 (which I borrowed to buy shoes in Springfield) I returned but I guess you did because you got the letter. I've got all of my debts paid now, Pearl Store, my board, Donohoo's, Ruby, and you. I wrote to Mrs. Moultrie too - All I owe, now is a letter to Ruby and I'll try to write it soon. Martin never did answer my letter. When you write tell him I'm looking for one. Lot's of Love,
Bess
