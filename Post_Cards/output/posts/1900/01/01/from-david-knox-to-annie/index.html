<p>To Annie</p>
<p>Dear Annie,
It's true I have not been writing to you much, since Nettie went up there knowing that you had a chance to hear from some of us pretty often. Would say we were sorry to hear of you being somewhat under the weather but hope ere this you are all right. Bad colds are very common now everywhere. The weather being so changeable no doubt is the cause. Your Ma and I have both had colds and Johnie had a fearful cough at night especially. He is now working everyday now on the section with Honan. Seems to like it very well of course. Mr. Honan is a good friend of his which is some difference. Boys must not have sister do too much and he is all the boys. You tell him I am having this boy in training. He says he know he can output him because he don't fall down. We are not getting impatient but ply want to see you a lll. Still more so as the expected time draweth near, I see no reason why George cannot come. It is only awhile spent and we all have to submit to losing time if any of us get sick. Try to get him to come. I like the tone of your last letter. It sounds as though you are coming some time , as I said, no use in waiting to get ready. Maggie is now making the machine work and has been for some days, so she will be in practice and have the machine in good order. Maggie is a machinist . She has just finished a dress for her Ma, Lizzie, and herself by some help from Lizzie F. Se says she will teach you all some new styles after you get here. I I suppose the children will be almost as big as she is, as she does not grow a bit. Still she is real handy to do anything she undertakes to do. I have not had a letter from Willie for some 10 days or more. Suppose he is well. He spoke of having bad colds-this is now a fair day. This after noon, but oh how muddy was the slush and snow. Nettie say you have got very big. That will be some surprise to us to see how having got so fresh. Iowa soil must be healthy for you folks as Nettie looks much fresher than when she left. I mean in her posture. Willie talked some of going west. Do you know anything about it? He merely mentioned that he had some notion to do so, but did not say when or positive about it. I will now close as the evening meal is about here and want to send this out. Respects to you all. Hoping to see you all soon in good health and in good spirits. I am as ever your Pa-
