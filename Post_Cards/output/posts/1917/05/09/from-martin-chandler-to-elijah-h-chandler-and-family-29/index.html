Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Got her evening of 7th. This sure is some town. One store and 2 or 3 restaurants. Not a very heavy job. Pays $87.50 and commissions all told ought to make it pay 100 but I'll only be here two or three days longer at least. I can stand on platform and throw across the Rio Grande into Old Mexico. Only about a hundred yards to River. Saw a whole bunch of Mexicans over there yesterday. Don't know what they were doing. I telegraph from 9 am to 3 pm. Express Commission ran $8.00 last month. Ha. He said it was a very poor month. Don't have very much to do. Have oil tanks here and have to contend with that but its nothing like Valentine. I kinda wish he hadn't out me on Valentine agency cause now I'll have to be running around working relief agencies and can't stay on my regular job and its more expensive to be running around here and there.
Do hope Margaret  is well. Awful glad to hear Lucerne made her grades. How did Knox make it? Too bad Margaret couldn't take examination. Did I mention receiving Papas and Mamas letters enclosing Bess'? Anyway I did and mighty glad to get them. Haven't heard anything from Cra yet but expect to in few days. Don't suppose I could get a pass up there anyway. I got a letter from MK 2 and they said they would be glad to furnish me pass San Antonio to St. Louis provided it was ok with me that they notify this road they had issued such transportation as required by I.C.C. Upon inquiry I found out that if I get pass from MK 2 that the RHASA will blacklist me from their road. They don't allow their employees to write for their own passes without taking up with them so that knocks me out of pass cause I don't want to have a bad record here. I don't see why in the dickens they should care who I get pass from. Guess if they wont furnish transportation I'll ride the cabooses. Wouldn't take me very long to get there. Sure will be glad when this war is over.
I'm going to work in Western Union this summer sure. It's good for $125.00 anytime. They have established an 8 hour day and overtime on Sundays now. That makes W.U. pretty good.
Well must stop and Get busy.
Better write me at Valentine. Expect to be back there by time you get this but if go someplace else can have my mail forwarded.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>
