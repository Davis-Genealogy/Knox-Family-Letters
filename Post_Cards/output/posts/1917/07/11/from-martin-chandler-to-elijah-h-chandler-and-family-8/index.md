Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
No mail since last writing. Expect to be assigned some time this week. I never have received any mail forwarded from Sanderson yet. Should have a good bunch of it pretty soon. Did you get my cards from Juane &amp; Max? Supposed you got my pictures I sent from Sanderson. I'm still doing messenger duty over at Captain's office. Don't have much to do. My you ought to see the soldiers drilling here. They get about 3000 out on parade ground and it sure is pretty to see them all moving. They have 6 or 8 bands playing all the time. There's about 5 camps here at Ft. Bliss. Wouldn't be surprised if I was assigned to one of them. Quite a bunch of infantry have been sent out of here lately. Some to Eagle Pass, TX, some to Salt Lake City, Utah and some to Syracuse. Wish they would ship me to Illinois. Lordy wish I had come home before enlisting but they told me Tuesday (Day 2 enlisted) that Saturday was last day could volunteer so I thought I'd better get in.
I'll send my clothes home first time I go to Taylor. Got 2 suit cases full.
Sure hot down here. These uniforms are pretty warm too. Generally go to bed about 8 or 9 pm. Have breakfast at 6 am. Then after breakfast everybody helps clean up camp except men detailed for special duty. They have to pick up every match and scrap on ground and then sweep the entire camp. Some of them have to wait on tables and some work in kitchens about 5 each. I've worked both of them. Say I worked in kitchen. I peeled 4 bushel potatoes; scrubbed tables and washed pots. I've worked every job they've got here expect to clean toilets. We have a dandy shower bath here. Each of us received a Toilet kit yesterday free of charge. Consisting of towel, shaving soap, brush, razor, shoe brush, clothes brush, tooth brush and box shoes polish and a bag to keep them in. Also got package needles and some thread. We're allowed about 40.00 worth clothes when we enlist. My outfit ran about 15.00. Got 3 suits summer underwear, 3 pair socks, 1 shirt and 1 uniform and pair shoes. Oh yes, got a pair overalls and jacket too. Each of us have our own mess kit consisting of fork, knife, spoon (large), and one pan. We take pan in kitchen and they fill it up. Always have radishes, onions, bread, butter, and ice tea, lemonade, or coffee on table. I've never got up from table hungry. We wash our own mess kit and bring them in and put them away. Have a free moving picture show over a 8th calvary every night. We're free to go where we please from 5&gt;45 pm to 11 pm except Sundays and holidays.Â We're off all day except men detailed for special duty, as I am. I did quite a letter writing today. Took bunch papers to Camp Stewart 10 miles distant and then made several other trips on horseback and I'm pretty tired and dusty so I'll quit and go take bath.
Expect to get a letter from Papa tomorrow for sure.
Sure hope everybody is OK.
Love to all,
Martin</body></html>
