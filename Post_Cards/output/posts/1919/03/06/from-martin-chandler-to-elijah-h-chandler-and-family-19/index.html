<p>Dearest Papa, Mama, and all:
Received dandy long letter from Papa yesterday and was sure glad to get it. Have received three letters from Papa since last writing. Has been about a week since I last wrote. Also received dandy letters from Bess and Lorin yesterday. Very glad to get them. Glad every body is well now. Nothing new to write. Everything going about the same in Ahrweiler. It is again rumored that we will leave the latter part of this month but I absolutely refuse to put any faith in rumors any more. The schedule says we will leave the latter part of April. I wont believe we are going home until we are actually on our way. I mailed you a book containing cartoons of the A.E.F. this morning. They were taken from the "Stars and Stripes". They come nearer to showing things as they really were than any I've ever seen. Some of them are sure comical but guess you'd have to be acquainted with the ways of the Army before you could appreciate them. Could only get one. They seemed to be pretty scarce. They cost 5 francs--thats about a dollar. Intend to answer Lorin's letter tonight. He wrote a dandy long letter. Will answer Bess' letter tomorrow. Don't have a great deal of time to write during the day cause we are kept pretty busy but am off every night at 5 pm. Gee--we sure are having lovely weather. Regular spring. Sure makes me want to be home. Lots of our fellows have gone away to school in France and England. Some of them went to Edinburgh, Scotland. They take a four months course in what ever subject they wish. I wouldn't stay over here four months longer for all the universities in the world. Don't suppose I could get in any way.
Have been feeling just fine and dandy. Never felt better in my life. Would like to be doing some out-door work. This is too good weather to stay inside all the time. I've been to the dentist about five times during the past week. Have had two teeth filled (1 upper and 1 lower) and have two more lower teeth to be filled. My teeth haven't bothered me since Dr. Hume did the work on them at White Hall about 8 or ten years ago. The two lowers to be filled now are the ones to be filled with silver. The two lowers to be fled now are the ones he filled with silver. The silver is too prominent and makes my teeth two black so the dentist here is going to take the silver out and fill them with cement. That's only thing they fill teeth with over here. Couldn't hardly expect any thing more though, seeing that it is free of charge.
I sure hate a dentists chair. Will be glad when the work is finished. Lord-I sure wish I was home and out of the army. Bet they don't get me in the army again. I'm so sick and tired of beans and rice that I never want to see them anymore. We did, however, have biscuits for dinner yesterday. Was sure surprised. They certainly tasted good. Haven't had an egg for about 6 or 8 months. They only cost about 15 cents a piece here. Sure are scarce.
Well, will close for this time. Hope you all keep on writing. Don't see how I could get along if it wasn't for the letters I get. Hope this finds you all well. Will write again soon.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>
