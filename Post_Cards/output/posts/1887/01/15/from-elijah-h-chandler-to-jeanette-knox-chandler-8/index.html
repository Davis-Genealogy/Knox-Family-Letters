Dear Nettie,
I received your kind letter yesterday and was glad to hear from you again as I always am. I will try and answer this morning but don't know how I will make it. Nothing to write about. They are going to have a festival at the church house next Friday night. They had a county meeting last night. Everybody is going to the fox chase today. I was glad to hear you are getting all right again. Yes I suppose the Dr. thought you was a good patient. He gave a visiting when he went to see you. I will be glad when your time is out in Iowa. It seems to me like you have been gone 6 years now. I let Maggie read the letter you wrote in answer to the one I told you about falling down on the platform. She liked to have taking a fit about it. I think the snow will go off and spare the sleighing if it don't turn cold pretty soon. This morning looks like a spring morning. Well I will be glad when spring comes again. I am getting tired staying in side so much. When does Johny think he will come home? Yes Nettie your letters are all interesting to me whether they are long or short. I don't think Jae will get a job soon but he could if he was a good operator. Theres a good chance for Operators now on this road. I thought yesterday I would see what Jae would do if he was alone. So I told him when the conductor signed the order to get it corrected. I was out in the passenger room. Jae gave the conductor signature to the order. Then the dispatcher asked him if the train was all ready to go. Jae near made him any answer then asked him again and Jae asked him what he said. Then the dispatcher said where is E. By that time I went in and fixed them up. It seems to me that Jae don't try to learn anything. I have gave him a good chance but I am not going to recumbent him until I know he can do what they want him to do. Jae has made a move on all of the Wells girls. Him and Billy Maynard both go out to Wells. Now they are awful thick. Now I will close for this time. Hopeful to hear from you soon. With all my love to you.
I am yours Truly,
E.H. Chandler</p>
