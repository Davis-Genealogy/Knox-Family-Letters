Mr. E.H. Chandler
Dear Lige,
Your letter dated 9th received today. I wrote you this morning and took my letter up town to mail it and where the PM handed me my mail. There was a letter from you and I was most truly glad to get it. Was sorry to hear that you was feeling badly but hope you are all right ere this. How about that bridge falling down. Was it the bridge across the river that you had reference too. If so was there anyone hurt. Oh dear! I do think that Bill Shea is the meanest man that ever stepped. Mattie ought to be very proud of her nice husband. I hope Shea and Sink will both get that they deserve and I hope this will bust them as high as a kite. I think that is a nice report and get out about Bull Shea playing poker in our house for money. I know it is not time but it is time he with some of the other boarders played cards but only for fun. I do not know anything about Pa selling whisky on Sundays. I cannot say that it is not so nor I will not say that it is so but I do hope and trust that he has not stooped so low as that. If he has, it was for that Old Schestein but I would hate to think of it being time. I do wish some one would just beat Shae into a jelly as he deserves when he does as he did to Martin Whalin.
Annie and children has retired  good while ago but I thought I would stay up and write you a little in answer to this letter. Of course I have not much to write now as I wrote all I could think of this morning but I thought I would write a line or two to let you know I received your letter and I knew if I went off tomorrow that I could not write then so I would stay up a while tonight. I have written a long letter to Maggie tonight also.
Oh Lige I would like so well to see you but wouldn't I talk. Why I would talk so much my tongue would be sure but Say- you don't want to be writing me the way you have been tipping your hat at other girls for I am awful jealous. Did you know it? I was awful jealous of Annie and you because of the flirtation you two kept up all the time we were there. Ha! Ha! I'll tell Annie about this tomorrow. Every time any one comes and asks me if I am getting homesick because I can answer Lucy does for me. She always says "Yes- she is homesick to see her fellow - Lige Chandler. He said he was going to keep me but I was not big enough to stay." That is the answer she makes to any body.
Well I did not think I could near fill up this sheet of paper when I commenced to write but I have did so and have no said anything much for foolishness. Write soon.
Yours,
Nettie</p>
