Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received papa's letter day before yesterday and another today and also received mama's and Bess' dandy letters enclosing Johns and Aunt Anna's and I certainly enjoyed them all. Was mighty glad to get them. Was first mail I've received since leaving Ft. Bliss. Am over at club tonight. Was at YMCA Thursday and Friday nights. Had a social Thursday night. In fact they have on every Thursday. Good program. Served ice cream and cake. Friday night was formal opening and dedication of YMCA. Had good speaking and good program.  Enjoyed it very much. These sure are good places to pass away time at night. All kinds of amusements. Lots of good books, both at YMCA and Club. The people here are very hospitable and some notable financial powers live in immediate vicinity of this place. Wilsons son-in-law lives only four miles from here. Was glad to get Lesley Wildt's address. Have been wanting it for past year. He and I used to chum together quite a bit. Haven't located Lake Denmark yet but will do so tomorrow and if not very far will get to see him. It is now rumored that we sail about the 3rd of next month. But have heard nothing definite but think we will leave pretty soon. Just found out yesterday that I can have all or part of my pay sent home by government so I'll put in a $20.00 allotment to be sent home each month. Had to give name of some relative today who should be notified in case of my death or an accident. All preparations indicate we will leave shortly. They're not fixing up camp very much and wont build anything or order any stoves for us, and it's pretty cold here too, so i guess we will leave shortly. I have another horse now. It's a fine big black horse. Awful powerful and can run like the wind. It's a great pet too. Did you get the Battalion picture ok? You didn't mention it but suppose you did. I'll try and have my picture taken with horse before I leave and send to you. Awful glad the children are getting along OK in school and mighty glad Lucerne can play so well. Wish I could have been there when Sam and all the rest were at home. I'd like mighty welt see Audrey Grace. To think I've a close relative that I can't see and don't when when I can - I'll bet she is a cute kid. We had General Inspecting this morning. Had all out filled equipment laid out and cleaned up nicely. Also had pistol inspection. We all have 45 Caliber Colts automatics. Sure are good guns. Thats all the weapons we have. Don't stand much show if we should happen to be compelled to repair or construct line of communication under fire. Of course we wont fight any this winter. Will probably train all winter in France and be ready for spring. Lots of men leaving everyday now for France. Uncle Sam is gathering them over there pretty fast.
Golly I'll certainly appreciate the sweater the girls are knitting. It will come in mighty handy. Yes, mama I've heard the songs you mentioned. "Over There" and "America Here's my Boy." Thats about all they sing out here. They all like "Over There" best of all. Glad to hear Aunt Sarah received her back pension money. Sure hope she stays well and is feeling good. Golly papa I'd like o be there and help out with the work. I know what apple season is there. All the crops through Missouri and Kansas are best ever so the farmers said when we passed through there. Is Grimaly working at "Dr." Papa? Sure hope you learn to use that bug OK  cause its a great labor saver and you can do so much better with it after learning to use it. What branch of service is Wade Maynard in? Guess there will be quite a few go over before the war is over. Saw in paper yesterday where the Pope's peace proposal had failed and he predicts the war will last for 3 years yet. Gee everything is high out here. Bacon is 47 cents pound. Eggs 70 cents dozen. Our laundry in Fr. Bliss cost each man $1.75 per month. No matter how much or how little we sen but I sent min in to Long Branch other day and it cost me $1.59 so it will amount to quite a little in a month. Well must close . Everybody write often. If can do so will give you address soon as we get across.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and All
Haven't had any mail for long while. Last letter I received was when all of you wrote together. Have been expecting mail in every day but none so far. I expect to get a bunch when some does come in. I'm back with the infantry now working radio. Sure was glad to get back. Nothing much new to write. Everything about the same. Having dandy weather. The summer certainly has passed quick. Can hardly realize it is now September. When one has lots of work the time sure flies. I dread the coming winter but this will be the last winter we'll have to put in over here. Of that, I'm sure.
I'm enclosing a letter addressed to members of the "Rainbow Division" telling of our past work. Think it is permissible to send them home.
Have done lots drilling past month and am glad its over. Sure hate to drill. Especially when its so warm.
The allies have been giving the Germs plenty to think about since the 18th of July. Only hope they don't let up on them. Believe me the old U.S.A. will sure look good to me if I ever see it again.
Well I'll have to stop for this time. All of you write as often as you can cause theres nothing I appreciate more than letters from home. Hope this finds all of you as well as it leaves me.
Lovingly,
Martin

Dearest Papa, Mama, and All
Receive the big letter yesterday enclosing all your letters and was mighty glad to get it. Also received a letter from Bess and once from Papa so you see it was a big day for me. I've received several letters from Papa since last writing. Haven't had much chance to write during past month. Have lots to tell but can't write it. Have had a lively time since last writing. At present I'm back with the 107 Battalion but was with the Iowa boys during the excitement. They sure are some scrappers. They kept the "Luns" traveling right along.
Was surprised to hear of the Garrison - Thurman affair. as there any legal action taken on either side?
Certainly would love to be home while you are all there but don't want to come until its over here. Hope it ends by winter. Te British, French, and American troops have got em on the run up their way.
What organization will Betts be in? So Rollin has decided to farm eh? He sure is good.
I lost one of my best pals lately. He and I had worked on Radio job since last April. He was well liked by all who knew him and it was a blow to all of us. He sure did his but though sure was a good man and didn't know what fear was.
We're having very good water over here. This is the most beautiful county I've ever seen. Lines of big trees on both sides the road and they certainly keep their roads in good shape. I'm camped on a river at present in a park with lots big shade trees. Am sleeping in a shelter tent and the river affords a good place to jump in every day. The nights are real cool which makes it great for sleeping.
hasn't rained any for quite a spell which is saying quite a bit cause it generally rains every day or so. One night, which advancing, we marched several miles over a road in mud up to our knees and about every 10 minutes some of us would slip and face down. The Germans had been moving their artillery, etc., even the road and that couple with the rain, sure made it a nice route to travel. It wasn't one of the main roads or I would have been in better shape. One could hear some shocking language along the way that night and they certainly had a right to cuss. Ha.
We've certainly done a lot of traveling on foot. Don't think I'll ever complain if I'm forced to walk a few miles when I'm back home, especially without a 50 pound pack on my back and a heavy pair of hob nail shoes to walk in.
We're getting good feeds and taken all around, in good shape.
So sorry to hear about poor Aunt Sarah. Hope things go easy for her. She was the very last person I saw in Pearl.
I ran across Jim Dalton other day. He was in this battalion for a while but later transferred to the engineers. I recognized him first thing and hadn't seen him for 12 years. Papa will remember him. At least he should cause he had to get up one morning at 2 am and go down and work for him. He said to give you his "73."
Let me know what batch of service and what organization Sam gets in when he is called - also Ralph, if he is called- believe you said Wade was in 317 San. Jr. didn't you?
Well I must close. Will soon be dark. I'll try and answer all those letters soon as I can. Was certainly glad to get that letter. I'll address Ruby and Sam at Wichita (811) and Grace and Lorin at Morrisonville and they can have them forwarded.
Hope this finds you all feeling as well as I am. Will write again soon.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and All,
Received the pictures from Mama this morning and was sure tickled to get them. They're all good too. Sure am proud of them. Nothing new to write went to church tonight. Sermon was just dandy. I signed up as member of Christian Endeavor tonight but don't think I'll be here over two more weeks. Their meetings are just like the ones at home. Hand out references etc. They have an awful poor building for a church but theres hardly enough people attend to build a good church.
Still got my cold but its getting better all the time. It's still pretty cool here. Don't guess we will have any more warm weather.
That was a dandy Kodak picture of Ote and Bess. All the Kodaks were fine. Papa have you been squirrel hunting yet this season? Sure would like to be there and go.
Is the Peore Store still doing business? Wonder if mrs. Moultrie is going to stay in Pearl?
I don't know anything to write so will stop. Sure glad you sent the pictures Mama. Tell Aunt Sarah and Uncle Jim hello.
Lovingly,
Martin

Dearest Folks,
Guess you think its about time some of us were writing but I have been so busy since I came home. I've hardly had time. The dust was force all over the house and it took some cleaning, then the washing and ironing had to be done and I have also canned a bushel of tomatoes so you can see it would keep me pretty busy.
Guess you are all lonesome since we've all left or maybe it will be a rest?
We arrived home about 9p.m., got off at Berdan and hired an auto to take us to Greenfield where we met Mr. Stocks and came on home with him.
Mother and Father had just gotten home the same evening from Kansas.
Have opened some of the jam you sent and it was surely fine. The canned Blackberries are the prettiest I ever saw. Will just have to thank you until you are better paid.
Did Bess go with Mae to Wichita as she expected to?
Will try to write sooner the next time. Hope you are all well. Had a nice time while at home. Much love to all.
Lovingly,
Grace</p>

Dearest Papa, Mamma, and all:
I intended writing sooner but for my part just neglected it.
We had a dandy trip home. Got here about 9 a.m. and have sure taken some fine rides in Loren's car. Have gone every night. Audrey has learned some new words, seems like she gets sweeter and smarter every day. Bet you all miss her. I ask her where Knox was and she said "all gone." The neighbors just have fits over her.
Have you made anything for Lucerne yet? Don't suppose you have hardly had time though.
There isn't so much to write that you would be interested in. It is awful dusty here, haven't had a rain since I came.
If you want me to come home any particular day tell me and I will write Opal to meeting at Granite and then I can get my shoes in St. Louis.
Guess Bess went with Ruby and Sam.
This is all for now.
Lovingly,
Margaret

<p>Friday Evening
Aug 2, 1918
Dearest Folks,
Arrived this afternoon at 3 o'clock. Bess and Mae got here at 6:30. We should have gotten here at 8:30 am but the C&amp;A was late, about an hour, and the Frisco had changed time of departure from St. L at 2 pm instead of 2:15 so we missed it by 10 minutes. So we didn't get out of St. L until 8:30 pm.
We ate lunch and as we started to Granite on the McKinley car Bill got on at the same time. He got a short furlough from Paris Island SC. Sam had such a good visit with him. Bill seems so much more talkative and jolly.
We were over there until 6:30 pm but the girls were in St. L shopping so we just did get to see them between the time they got there till the next car. We had had dinner in St. L and by the time we got back and ate supper we just had time to get our train.
A young woman and her baby happened to be on the same pullman and had been visiting at the Legits at Waterford, Ohio where Sam and I visited. When I was talking to her she mentioned having been to Ohio and I told her my husband and I had been there too before we went to visit at Ill and she said "I'll bet you are Mrs. Sam Mulholland" and you can imagine how surprised I was. She was coming to Eldorado, Kas.
(Tues) I didn't get this mailed when my intentions were so good too to write immediately.
It has been murderously hot here. Sunday it was 106 degrees at 2 pm and it was almost unbearably at nights until last night.
It was pretty tough to see him leaving and it will still be hard to get along without him. But I am hoping he gets to stay at Ft. Riley so he wont be so far away. The train was supposed to leave at 6 am yesterday but it was finally 7:30 before the train left. The W.C.T.W. women presented each draftee with a comfort kit - a khaki bag containing a money pouch, an expense book, needles and thread packets and several things so handy. Sam was real proud of his.
I can anyway look forward to his letters and be interested in what I can scrape up to tell him.
I am enclosing a check for Margaret's operation. I wish she could stay there at M-Ville long enough to go to the Springfield Fair and then have Dr. meet you and Margaret about the 14th to have her tonsils and adenoids removed. Will you write to Dr. right away and see if he can manage to go at that time.
Maybe Opal will loan Margaret an extra gown or two for hospital use and I don't know what inconvenience there could be for Mae described Virginia's case so well I know there'll be very little, if any, extra expense. Lucerne can manage the housekeeping while you are in Granite and Maybe Warren can take you and Margaret to the hospital in his car. Maybe its a good plan to have Margaret come to Granite and be there when you and Dr. go down so you all could go right out to the hospital first thing and you'd have no responsibilities regarding the cars or locating the hospital.
I'll surely be relieved for her to start into school without that hinderance to her speech and breathing.
School begins here the 9th. I'm sure Papa can bring the girls to KC and put them on their train for Wichita. Will try to have all arrangements made for them so if they don't get here until  few days before the 9th it will be OK. I guess Papa can have their passes by that time.
We're anxious to hear of Martin, so let us know as soon as you hear.
We have a little ironing to do before we go to Mae's so we have to get busy.
last but not least, we sure did enjoy the buns, and we were glad too to get the yeast since each of us forgot it. Thanks for sending so quickly the things we over looked. Write soon and let us know plans.
Lots of Love,
Ruby</p>

Dearest Folks,
Received letter from Papa and one from Bess today and sure glad to get them. Just received one from Papa and one from Mama yesterday. Wrote you short letter yesterday at another place. Would like to tell you of my whereabouts but thats out of the question. Watch the Kansas City papers for news of the 117th (Rainbow Div.).
I can't think of anything to write except things that I can't mention so I'll have to make this short. I've been through several gas attacks and come through OK. I wouldn't take a fortune for my gas mask. Have also been under heavy shell fire but always had good dug outs.
We're having great weather. Roads are pretty dusty but it rains quite frequent over here.
I'll have to stop and go to supper. Don't know when I'll get a chance to write again but will write as often as I can. Tell Bess I'll answer her letter at first opportunity. Everybody write often. Hope you are all well.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

No mail since last writing. Don't know of anything new to write so will cut this short. Raining today pretty hard. Of course hard very often. It generally pours. Am feeling good and getting along OK. Wrote grace few mins ago. Forgot to mention that I received dandy long letter from her few days ago. Has Bess gone to Wichita yet? Will Ruby come home when Sam goes? Was in hope he wouldn't come. Guess the boys at Taylor will be leaving pretty soon if they haven't already.
How does that new ditch work? You know I've never seen that. Guess there will be quite a few new things for me to do around there if I come back. Think we will be paid tomorrow. Wont take me long to get rid of mine. A need a supply of tobacco and a razor if I can find one. Think they have some Gillette safety razors here for $5.00 and I'm going to get one if can find any. I draw $10.10 per month including foreign services pay and insurance and all amounts to $26.50 so thats a total of $36.60 per month. That's not so bad. Of course we get paid in French money. 1 Franc equals about 17.5 c or about 5 Fr. 70 cents to the dollar.
The Americans sure spend lots of money over here. The francs don't seem to be valued as much as an American piece of money. They think nothing of spending 100 Fr while if it was a $20.00 bill they would go slower with it. Eggs cost 5 fr a dozen and all the groceries etc are about 2 or 3 times as much as in the states. A can of tomatoes that costs 15 cents over there costs about 60 cents here. We get out washing done up good, though, very cheap.
Well must stop. Will write again soon as get a chance. Everybody write often.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dearest Grace Lorin &amp; Audrey
Received Grace's letter few days ago but haven't had much chance to answer until now. Was mighty glad to get it. Noted the clippings you enclosed. Guess I'll be out of luck for Audrey's picture. I sure do want it too. Don't know of anything new to write. Am getting along ok and feeling fine. Think this will be the last I'll get to write for several days. Will try and write papa &amp; mama today but in case I don't wish you'd pass this one along so they'll know I'm ok yet.
Been having dandy weather up until today and its raining pretty hard today. Has Lorin changed positions yet.
Guess you have been reading the war news and note where the Americans took part. I get both the French and German Communiques each day. The Germans don't seem to think much of america as an enemy but they're going to be rudely awakened someday. They lost pretty heavily on their last drive and what ground they gained wasn't worth what they paid for it. Don't think their attempt to blockade the american coast with submarine will amount to much. More troops are arriving here all the time.
Wonder if Wade &amp; Jess have left Camp Taylor yet? Guess they'll be over here before long.
Well I can't think of anything to write so will close. Haven't received any mail, expect your letter for past 2 weeks but am expecting some today. Write often.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>
