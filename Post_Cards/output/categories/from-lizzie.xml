Miss Nettie Knox,
Dear old Gal, it is now I will try to answer your welcome letter which I received some days ago. Was truly glad to hear from you as I did not look for a letter so soon. Maggie started for St. Louis this eve I think she will have a nice time. She and Mrs. Crohm has gone together. She is going to stay a week. Oh wont she have a flip time. She made her brown dress. It fits splendid. She also made her calico she had splendid luck in making her dresses. Oh she looked so nice, she wore my hat.
Oh yes that Hill don't forget the way to come. I think he must be interested. Some may hurrah for Hill and Chandler. Poor Lidge, he nearly dies. He gets so lonesome, he said the other day that he had got a letter from you. I ask him when you were coming home, he said he did not know when but he wished that he did know.
Oh yes they had a dance here Wednesday night. Rothia Young and Maggie Hawk were ones they reported splendid time. But I tell you they can't get us two girls in to dancing.
Uncle Dave and Uncle Jim went to Pittsfied. They went to the Democratic Rally, they report a large crowd.
Annie Coates hasn't been here for some time. She is mad Chrley Hess went with her one night - from church and since that night - he has got terrible friendly with Lizzie F.
Sunday Morning: Will finish, Oh you ought to see Lidge with his stiff hat on he looks Boss in it.
Lizzie is coming over to eat dinner. Well it's nearly mail time. Lidge has just gone from dinner. Has the children got the whooping cough. Write all the news. Lou, Hess came home Friday but will go back. Love to all,
Every your Cousin,
Lizzie&lt;/p&gt;
