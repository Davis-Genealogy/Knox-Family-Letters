Dearest Everyone,
Though I'd better write few lines right away as I just had a letter from Bess and Knox saying mama intended to visit me and I wanted to tell her that I've moved again. They transferred me to ward 11, annex 2 Wednesday evening. I didn't even get an examination at general hospital. Guess Mama is there now. Sure will be glad if she can come up. Hope some of you can come up. Hope some of you can come with her. I don't know what they're figuring on doing with me. I feel fine and dandy. I'm afraid my compensation claim will get a set back if the diagnosis made here stands. 'Course I wont care if the diagnosis is correct. Naturally, I'd rather be free from TB than have the pay.
We had good dinner yesterday. I'll enclose the menu. I'm the afternoon a lot of us went to football game, Marquette vs. Ames, Marquette winning 6 to 0. We had passes. I had a notion to ask for pass to come down there for Thanksgiving but when they transferred me Wednesday evening, I didn't have a chance, as the doctor on this ward was gone Thanksgiving day.
I like this ward better than any I've been in so far. Only two beds in each room and the rooms are nice. We ear at Annex 1, only a block away. Eat in general dining room.
Mama when you come up, take the north shore line. Get off at 1st Ave and National Ave. Thats a regular hop on the North Shore line. Then you catch a National Ave. car, which would bring you right up in front of our place. Or else if you'll let me know what time you'll be here, and how you're coming, I'll meet you down town. I don't expect to be here very long. I don't think there's anything wrong with my thyroid gland, and if I haven't got I want to get out.
The American Legion, Wisconsin Department, sent each man here a check for $1 yesterday. There's about 500 here. I squandered mine on a show after the football game.
Russ, I stopped in at journal yesterday. Scott was only man on duty. He said HJD got beat up and was in hospital. That so? He hadn't heard that WS got slugged. He showed me a letter he had written to PDP asking for a raise. Grammatically, it was a farce.
Well, I'm out of paper so will sign off.
Mama, you be sure to let me know when you are coming.
Love to all,
Mart.

My Dearest Mama,
This is Mother's day so I wanted to write you a few lines: a year ago today I was in Lorraine but I didn't write you a very long letter. I don't know just what to write now but I'm mighty glad to have a Mama to write to even if I don't write much.
Have been making preparations to leave for past two days. They say we will get out either tomorrow or next day so I think I can be pretty sure of being home next Sunday cause they say we will be discharged 2 hours after arrival in demobilization camp. There have been several train loads of men going out of here each day since I've been here. Seems like I've been here a month but only landed 2 weeks ago today. Gee but I'll certainly be glad to get home and see you all. Have moved to another casual company here and they feed fairly well. I'll be glad when I'm through with this army. I wouldn't follow the army for a living if  they paid ever so much.
I'll bet Knox is a big boy now. And just think-I've a nephew and niece that I've never seen. I hope they look like their mother. I think Lorin and Sam were pretty lucky, don't you Mama? Believe me, it isn't everyday you find girls like yours mama. I'm certainly proud of my sisters.
Been raining here a whole lot lately. Makes it very muddy and slushy outside. We have a good place to sleep. Have a bed sack filled with straw and a good spring bed. Have breakfast at 7 am. Don't have to stand reveille or any formations. That doesn't make it much easier though. When a fellow gets to the states he doesn't want to lay around in a Casual Camp especially in a town like Newport News. All they look for is a soldier's money.
Well, Mama, will close for this time. Here's hoping I'll be home sometime this week. Am feeling great will wire you all from camp I'm discharged in.
Lots Love,
Martin&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>From: Martin Chandler</category><category>Letter</category><category>To: Jeanette Knox Chandler</category><guid>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1919/05/11/from-martin-chandler-to-jeanette-knox-chandler/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 1919 22:37:36 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>From: Martin Chandler, To: Elijah H.

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all,
Well I'm in another camp now. Was sent there from Camp Morrison. Most of the Signal Corps went to Camp Funston, Kansas. They were from Kansas City. Darn the luck--there was a bunch of fellows went to Camp Grant, Illinois yesterday, but I was billed for Texas and couldn't go with them. I went to our Company clerk and told him I wanted to go to Illinois and he said they would send me there but found out later that I would have to make request for reclassification and make affidavit that my home was in Illinois so that knocked me out of going yesterday. I made out the request as soon as I got to this camp and fixed the affidavit up but don't know just when I'll get out of here. Probably in two or three days. Sure having lovely weather. Sure wish I was home. Would like to go finishing. Bunch of men got out of here today going to North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Nebraska. As soon as they get a bunch for one state they send them out. Hope some men for Illinois gets in here soon. Sure hate to lay around this camp. I worked hard yesterday and last night on our service records getting them filled up to date so the men could get out. Worked until midnight last night. Had to make out final endorsements, fill out cards etc., am all through now. Don't feed very good here. I ate three meals in Newport News but they cost so darn much that I haven't gone down any more. That Newport News is a good deal worse than France for robbing the soldiers. A lady charged me 75 cents other day for sewing on three service chevrons. I didn't suppose it would be more than ten or fifteen cents cause it didn't take more than three minutes to do it. I told her she had just as well stand at the door with a gun and take the money as they came in. Then I went to the barber shop and got a haircut and shave and they charged me $1.25. Lord but they sure do rob a man. Frenchmen are angels compared to these robbers. Well I hope I'll soon be home. There are so many soldiers coming in here that it doesn't excite the interest of the people here at all. You'd think you were landing in some foreign country as far as the people evincing any interest in your arrival is concerned.
General Clark, adjutant General of Missouri was out to the Battalion at Camp Morrison other day and made a talk to the men. Said Kansas City was preparing a great reception for the signal corps, but of course that means the Kansas City men. They wouldn't have had any signal Corps if it hadnt been for the causals that were transferred into it. The Kansas City men proper didnt do much excel lay around at Division headquarters, most of the time away from shell fire and gas. Golly but I'll be glad to get home.
Well don't know any more to write so will close. Will wire from ou from the camp in Illinois that I'm sent to when I will leave there. Hope you are all well
Lots love to all,

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Well guess I'm stuck here until next week - there is a shipment of men going out of here Saturday for Illinois and I tried to get in with them but they said it was full up and said I'd probably get out of here next week - Golly but it makes me sore. Here it is only Wednesday and I'll probably be here until next wednesday. I heard over in germ nay that they were discharging men 24 hours after their arrival in the US. I landed here the 27th and wont be out until about the 14th of this month. I don't see why in the dickens I can't go with that bunch Saturday. This sure is a rotten camp. Don't get hardly anything to eat -I'd like to tell this Newport News bunch just what I think of them.
Don;t do a blessed thing but lay around all day in this darned camp. Lordy - I wish I was home. I get so sore every time I think about staying here another week that I'd like to cuss the whole bunch.
Write me here. Think probably it will reach me before I leave.
I haven't written Grace and Lorin since landing cause I don't know their address. Certainly hope you are all well. Guess I'll be home someday.

Dear Lorin, Grace, and Audrey
just few lines tonight while have an opportunity to write. This will be last letter I'll write in Germany. Post office closes in Morning. Haven't received any mail from you all since last writing. Hear from Papa every time mail comes in. Won't get anymore mail on this side of water. Division headquarters leaves here for Brest on the 5th. The Signal Battalion leaves here 3:50 am the 10th. Probably arrive Brest the 13th or 14th and embark about the 16th or 17th. Will be in states by time this letter reaches you. At present I'm billed to be demobilized in Texas. That's because I enlisted there but I'm pretty sure I can have it changed to Camp Taylor, Kentucky because it would cost the government less to send me to Taylor than it would to Texas. The majority of the Signal Battalion will be mustered out in Camp Taylor. I worn have vert far to go from there to see you all. Golly, but I'm certainly tickled we are going.
There will be 23 trains more theDivision to Brest. 24 american box cars to a train and 45 men to a car. They figure on making the trip to Brest in 60 hours. We leave on the 20th train. Had physical examination yesterday. I passed ok but there were quite a few who didnt pass, due to their own misconduct. They were sent to hospital and Lord only knows when they'll get home. I'd certainly hate to be in their shoes.
Having hie weather now but had quite a spell of rotten weather lately.
We'll I'll have to stop. Sure hope I get to come to Taylor to be discharged. Will wire you when I arrive in States but don't be surprised if the telegram comes collect -Ha.
Well hope you are all well. Will see you soon.
Lots Love

Dearest Papa, Mama, and All
No mail since last writing. Guess I wont write very many more times from Germany . Division headquarters leaves on first train April 2nd for Brest. Rest of the division will follow and I think we will all be out of here by the 6th. Don't know how long we will lay in Brest but they say we will stay there no longer than is necessary to embark. Oh Lordy but I'll certainly be glad when I get on that ship and know that I'm really on my way home. All men are Classified here and will be sent to different camps in the States to be demobilized. I'm listed to go to Camp Bowie, Texas because I enlisted in El Paso. I tried to get it changed here but couldn't but am going to try as soon as we get to the states. I certainly don't want to go to Texas to be discharged and then have to pay carfare home. The rest of the signal camps, lot rather, those who enlisted at points in Central Miss Valley will be demobilized at Camp Taylor Kentucky. that's where I'd like to gland thats where I'm going to try and get them to send me cause then I could drop in on Lorin and Grace and it wouldn't take me long to get home from there. I rather dread the ride to Brest in Box cars but we'll be "Homeward Bound" so it won't be so bad.
Guess I forgot to enclose that speech the other day cause I found it in my pocket today. Will enclose it together with a letter from Gen. pertaining to our Commanding General.
Understand we get to keep our gas masks and helmet. I'm certainly going to bring mine home. We are going to be paid off before we leave ere but I've only got about 10/000 cummings. Had to pay for suit of underwear out of this pay. I left it somewhere or another and they charged me about 6.00 for it. They sure stick a man when he loses anything. I'll be glad to have the 10 bucks though cause we wont have much to at on the trip to Brest and that will give me a chance to buy cakes etc while going through France. They charge like the dickens in France and I expect I'll hit the states dead broke but I'll be glad to get there under any circumstances.
Everything is in readiness for the divisions departure. The general has already left for Brest. We will be deloused before boarding train at Remagen. Remagen is about 12 miles from here, on the Rhine river. We'll have to hike that distance with our packs. Pack contains 3 blankets, shirt, suit of underwear, bed sack, 3 pair of socks and reserve rations in addition to toilet articles and mess kit. Besides that have to carry rain coat, overcoat, gas mask helmet, canteen, and pistol belt. All told will weight about 100 pounds and you can imagine what it will be to walk 12 miles carrying 100 pounds. Oh well I should worry cause it will be the last time we'll have to hike any distance and so long as we're going home I don't care what we have to do just so we get there.
Just had a long talk with old pal of mine. He called me up from 2nd Division. He's still in the First Field B'n. Said he expects to stay a year. Gee but he's homesick. Says he wishes we was with me. I'm mighty glad I'm not in the regular army now.
Been having some rotten weather past 10 days. Rains or snows every day. Only a short time ago it was nice spring weather. Gee but I'll be glad to get out of this country. The German people hate to see us leave because they've received pretty good treatment at our hands.
Well I must close and go to work. Am on duty tonight at Message Center. Expect the Message Center will be one of the last details to leave here. Hope I'm in the states by time this reaches you. Will wire you when I arrive.
Lovingly,
Martin&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>From: Martin Chandler</category><category>Letter</category><category>To: Elijah H.

&lt;p&gt;Dearest Papa, Mama, and all:
Received dandy long letter from Papa yesterday and was sure glad to get it. Have received three letters from Papa since last writing. Has been about a week since I last wrote. Also received dandy letters from Bess and Lorin yesterday. Very glad to get them. Glad every body is well now. Nothing new to write. Everything going about the same in Ahrweiler. It is again rumored that we will leave the latter part of this month but I absolutely refuse to put any faith in rumors any more. The schedule says we will leave the latter part of April. I wont believe we are going home until we are actually on our way. I mailed you a book containing cartoons of the A.E.F. this morning. They were taken from the "Stars and Stripes". They come nearer to showing things as they really were than any I've ever seen. Some of them are sure comical but guess you'd have to be acquainted with the ways of the Army before you could appreciate them. Could only get one. They seemed to be pretty scarce. They cost 5 francs--thats about a dollar. Intend to answer Lorin's letter tonight. He wrote a dandy long letter. Will answer Bess' letter tomorrow. Don't have a great deal of time to write during the day cause we are kept pretty busy but am off every night at 5 pm. Gee--we sure are having lovely weather. Regular spring. Sure makes me want to be home. Lots of our fellows have gone away to school in France and England. Some of them went to Edinburgh, Scotland. They take a four months course in what ever subject they wish. I wouldn't stay over here four months longer for all the universities in the world. Don't suppose I could get in any way.
Have been feeling just fine and dandy. Never felt better in my life. Would like to be doing some out-door work. This is too good weather to stay inside all the time. I've been to the dentist about five times during the past week. Have had two teeth filled (1 upper and 1 lower) and have two more lower teeth to be filled. My teeth haven't bothered me since Dr. Hume did the work on them at White Hall about 8 or ten years ago. The two lowers to be filled now are the ones to be filled with silver. The two lowers to be fled now are the ones he filled with silver. The silver is too prominent and makes my teeth two black so the dentist here is going to take the silver out and fill them with cement. That's only thing they fill teeth with over here. Couldn't hardly expect any thing more though, seeing that it is free of charge.
I sure hate a dentists chair. Will be glad when the work is finished. Lord-I sure wish I was home and out of the army. Bet they don't get me in the army again. I'm so sick and tired of beans and rice that I never want to see them anymore. We did, however, have biscuits for dinner yesterday. Was sure surprised. They certainly tasted good. Haven't had an egg for about 6 or 8 months. They only cost about 15 cents a piece here. Sure are scarce.
Well, will close for this time. Hope you all keep on writing. Don't see how I could get along if it wasn't for the letters I get. Hope this finds you all well. Will write again soon.
Lovingly,
Martin&lt;/p&gt;

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received letter from Papa today dated Jan 10th. Doesn't take mail very long to get here now. Certainly was glad to get it. Glad to know Ruby has recovered from the flu. First I had heard of her sickness. Sure is good to know you are all well. I'm still on the same job but expect to attend school at Coblens commencing next Monday. Cobblers is a pretty large city. Not much news about when we will leave but general impression is that we will start about the 1st of March. Certainly hope we do cause I'm mighty anxious to get home. Picked up some Radio press last night. Said 42nd and 32nd divisions would be first complete national guard units home and 77th Division would be first drafted division home. Like to get home and bid in some of there jobs that are on bulletin.
Having a show here nearly every night. Will mail you some of the programs if I can find them. Having a German grand opera tonight but I'm on duty and can't go. However they're having another one tomorrow night so guess I'll go to it. Doesn't cost anything. Have a swell theatre, looks just like the ones in the states.
Forgot to mention that I received letter from Papa other day enclosing copy of Mr. Doocy's letter. Glad you mailed them a copy of my letter. If I'm ever in Pittsfield I'll call on them.
Found out about my allotment today. it's still infect and will continue until I get out of the army.
Hope you're getting it regularly. I've been feeling just fine. Feel like I want to get out and run all the time. Have a great big feather bed to sleep in. Get lots of sleep, plenty to eat and not much work. I'll be all ready to go to work after I see you all and visit Ruby and Grace.
Think we get one months extra pay when we're discharged. That will by me a suit of clothes. It wont take me long to make enough to fit myself out with plenty of clothing. Certainly would like to get into a suit of civilian clothes again.
Rumor has it that when we leave here we sail on the Rhine up to Belgium. Sounds plausible.
Division is ranting 14 day leaves now to men who wish to visit relatives in Scotland, Ireland, England, or Italy. Guess that doesn't include me case if I have any relatives in any of those countries I don't know it. Besides I haven't the funds to provide for such a trip. Wouldn't mind going to Italy. They say Rome is a wonderful place. I'll be satisfied if they'll just send me home though. Don't think I'll ever cross the Atlantic again, once I get on the other side. Hows Knox making it? Certainly was tickled to hear about Audrey talking in her sleep and saying "God Bless her little heart." Ha ha.
I certainly did get the Christmas box and I want to say that I enjoyed it ever so much. I've a lot of back mail coming yet if it ever gets here.
Be glad when the Conference gets a peace treaty ready for Germany to sing. Hope they get things settled in Russia. See where our troops are fighting there.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Envelope Included</category><category>From: Martin Chandler</category><category>Letter</category><category>Mentions Military Service</category><category>To: Elijah H.

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received two letters from Papa day before yesterday dated Dec 12 and 18th both saying Mama and Anna were sick with influenza. Sure hated to hear it. Hope they are well by now. Don't think much of that influenza.
Not much news to write. Every thing about the same as I wrote in my last letter. Am 23 years old today. Getting to be an old man -Ha. One year ago today I was in hospital at Havre, France with measles. Sure am anxious to get home. Nothing new about leaving here.
We have a YMCA and Red Cross here. Red Cross serves hot chocolate and cake every day and generally have an entertainment every night. Going to have a dance tonight from 7 pm to 9 pm. Bunch of American girls coming up from Coblenz.
Still having good weather. Suppose it is pretty cold around there now. Would like to take in some of the skating there. Guess I'll be there next winter.
Notice by Papa's letter that the girls at Wichita didn't come home for Christmas. Must have been pretty lonesome at home with everybody gone.
Well must stop and get busy. Only had time for a few lines. Hope Mama and Anna are up and around before now. Will write again soon.
Lovingly,
Martin&lt;/p&gt;

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all,
Received letter from Papa yesterday and I'll say right now that I was mighty glad to get it. First mail I have received since 1st of Oct. Great to know everybody is well. Didn't know Mama was in Wichita. Sure glad to hear Ruby and child were doing well. How much does he weigh? Gee! I'm an Uncle twice now and haven't seen either one of my new relations yet but hope to before very long. We're all full of hope that we will be home by February 11th. Having very mild weather over here. Have a dandy place to stay. Nice warm fire and plenty of straw for a bed.
Just read in "Stars and Stripes" the concluding installment of the work done by A.E.F. since being in France. Written by General Pershing to Sec'y Baker. The first installment was in "Stars and Stripes" last week. It is very interesting. He doesn't give the 42nd much praise but they certainly deserve as much as any Division and more than some of the Divisions. Suppose it will be published in the Hate's so you'll have a chance to read it.
Hope the telegraphers get the raise they're after. Relay jobs and W.U. jobs should pay pretty good. Don't think I'll waste much time in going to work when I return. Haven't done much today. Just lounged around our billet. Had beef potatoes and tomatoes for dinner. Rice pudding for dessert.
I signed pay roll for 3 months pay other day. Have $120.60 coming minus 86.00 for allotments and insurance. I dont know how my allotment stands and wont find out until my service record gets back. Hope it is still going home. I made allotment 1st of Sept. 1917 good for one year. In July 1918 we had another form to sign account could only make $15.00 through government and any additional amount was to be made through Quartermaster. Don't know whether I told you of this before or not. I made $15 through QM in July 18 but don't know for how long its effective. If it was annulled 1st of September I'll get the allotment they have been charging me with, on a later pay.
We have a pretty fair shower bath here for which we are all thankful. It's a mighty hard job to keep rid of the cooties-Ha.
Well I must close. Hope I get my back mail real soon. Will write again in few days.
Lovingly,
Martin
