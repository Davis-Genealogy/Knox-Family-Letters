&lt;p&gt;Dear Aunt Nett,
Just a few lines to thank you for your nice letter which we recieved some time ago. We are getting along nicely but it is sure lonely without my dear Mother. I don't think I'll ever get over missing her. Ruby has been so loyal to use. I don't know what we would have done without here. G.C. worked at the elections board yesterday and isn't home yet this a.m. Roosevelt sure went over big. I hope he can do something for us.
We wish you would come out here again this winter and make us a nice visit.
Mae was down for a week or more, fixing up the house on Holyoke. It is for rent again. Write when convenient.
Much Love,
Inez and Grover&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Envelope Included</category><category>From: Inez and Grover</category><category>Letter</category><category>To: Jeanette Knox Chandler</category><guid>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1932/11/01/from-inez-and-grover-to-jeanette-knox-chandler/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 1932 00:54:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>From: Ruby Chandler Mullholland, To: Jeanette Knox Chandler </title><link>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1930/12/26/from-ruby-chandler-mullholland-to-jeanette-knox-chandler-3/</link><dc:creator>admin</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140526_16502141_0325.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-803" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140526_16502141_0325.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140526_16502141_0325" width="1631" height="2555"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140526_16501161_0324.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-804" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140526_16501161_0324.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140526_16501161_0324" width="1637" height="2555"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140526_16510406_0327.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-805" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140526_16510406_0327.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140526_16510406_0327" width="1619" height="2555"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140526_16505426_0326.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-806" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140526_16505426_0326.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140526_16505426_0326" width="1631" height="2555"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140526_16512644_0329.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-807" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140526_16512644_0329.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140526_16512644_0329" width="1625" height="2555"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140526_16511663_0328.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-808" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140526_16511663_0328.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140526_16511663_0328" width="1631" height="2555"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140526_16515102_0331.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-809" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140526_16515102_0331.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140526_16515102_0331" width="1625" height="2561"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140526_16514122_0330.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-810" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140526_16514122_0330.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140526_16514122_0330" width="1625" height="2555"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/1930/12/postcard-2014-20140528_16532561_0337.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-820" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/1930/12/postcard-2014-20140528_16532561_0337.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140528_16532561_0337" width="2141" height="1145"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140526_16514122_0330.jpg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wrapper on your box came from Mae. She sent me a coral necklace and hose to Sam and Gene.
Wichita, Kansas
December 25, '30
Dearest Mama and Mart
Since I have an hour or so left over I thought I'd get your letter answered today and let you know how we spent Christmas.
We went down to Grove's and Inez's along about 10 am but had our own tree and gifts at home early this a.m. Inez had a small tree but we all exchanged candy except that they gave Gene gloves and hose. He also got 2 lovely pair of golf hose from Mae and Art and Bob gave him a dollar. He faired awfully well considering things. Sam gave me hose and I gave him a tie. We gave Gene a bugle, books and a drinking set. A girl here in town brought down a big box of chocolates with a note, "Mostly for Gene" on it. She came over to my house at El Dorado on Thanksgiving and ever since, she has been so generous. Kathryn Hutchinson is her name. I didn't even send them a card. I didn't miss very many though. I had a stack of them. An awfully nice one from Dr. Garrison. I noticed Mart had forwarded it from Pearl. Was glad to get a line from all the family so soon again. So I'll write them all and then I'll be all set to hear again.
Don't be surprised when I tell you to change our address soon. We aim to get our furniture over in about two weeks and move into a house in the 3700 block on North Lawrence. But I'll let you know when we do. Just write here and I'll drop a line later. I don't know yet how long I'll be at Dr.'s as there is such a slump in business. He told me to come back though and I noticed he paid off several others as he wouldn't be needing them but of course even he doesn't know how business will continue. Sam will go to work for an oil Co. here Jan 1. Don't know his duties exactly - but its with oil rigs, etc. Which is something in our favor.
We had a lovely dinner at Inez's. Grove had bought a turkey and Bob had one given to him through the Sheriff so he and his girl and a boy friend also a friend of Grove's besides us were there. Mae and Art didn't come because they thought Dick was to be at home and and he was sent to Ottawa, Kansas on a job this a.m. so Mae's plans were all broken into. They're rather at sea anyway on account of Mother Davis being so low. She can't get well now so its just a matter of how long her constitution can hold out. She surely is hearty - in frame that is - but has sinking spells and is bedfast. Inez has a colored girl so we didn't have to do much all day. We had turkey with dressing, asparagus - buttered, mashed potatoes, giblet gravy with hard boiled egg diced in it, cranberry jelly, pumpkin pie, cake, coffee and rolls. We had fruit cocktail made of grapefruit, orange, pears, peaches, and some cherry in it. We also had waldorfaud salad. This cook had put a little sweet pickle in the waldorfaud and it was awfully good for a change. We had celery too. So we had such a big dinner and no work and they wouldn't let me bring a thing. So it sure was easy on me. You know about how much time one has left when working. I made some candy last night and this a.m. and I'm going to mail a box to you and I was sorry not to get it to you before. I only sent Annie a story book but I think I can get a box of candy to her for New Year's Day. I just write her address c/o of State Hospital, Dixon Illinois. I never have had a line from them either so a person never can tell whether she gets anything or not. I was so glad to hear of Lucerne's baby doing better. I thought I might get a letter written to her too but owe one to Grace first, so I'll try and get it written tonight.
We have had such nice rather the past week but it looks different tonight, like it might snow. But I guess we might expect winter from now on.
Gene will be out of school for about then days so he'll get in a lot of play. He has two or three friends he visits back and forth with and I know their people are nice so I don't worry about him just so I know where he'll be all the time. He is awfully good about sticking around home and he reads a lot and does quite a bit around the house. He comes down to the store, runs errands and goes to a show now and then, so his time is pretty well filled up.
Mr. Skaggs has had a serious attack of something like diabetes. He's a man a great deal like Uncle Jim was and I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't go like he did. Mrs. Skaggs wrote me they will stay in Kansas City until he goes to hospital for a general exam. So I'll have to write her soon again. You know we pay her storage for our furniture but I want it over here so bad and now think we can get a good house reasonable.Â Must quit now. Write soon. Hope all well.
Lots Love,
Ruby&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>From: Ruby Chandler Mullholland</category><category>Letter</category><category>To: Jeanette Knox Chandler</category><guid>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1930/12/26/from-ruby-chandler-mullholland-to-jeanette-knox-chandler-3/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 1930 22:50:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>From: Paul Knox and Family, To: Jeanette Knox Chandler </title><link>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1930/12/22/from-paul-knox-and-family-to-jeanette-knox-chandler/</link><dc:creator>admin</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140521_18013285_0317.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-790" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140521_18013285_0317.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140521_18013285_0317" width="1703" height="1169"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/1930/12/postcard-2014-20140528_17024910_0347.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-825" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/1930/12/postcard-2014-20140528_17024910_0347.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140528_17024910_0347" width="1761" height="1229"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Grandma,
I'm getting along pretty well in school. How are you getting along. I would like to know what I am going to get for Christmas but I do not know yet. I will have to wait a little while. Are you coming this Christmas. I hope you will and if you do come I will be awful glad. What are you going to get me. Mother said she bet I wasn't going to get anything if I wasn't a good boy.
From your loving grandchild,

Wednesday Night
My Dear Mrs. Chandler
Ever since we've been home I have wanted to write you a note but so far have done nothing but "put off."
I do want you to know thought - how much I enjoyed meeting you and what pleasant memories I brought back of the lovely dinner and the enjoyable day spent in your home. We would surely love to have you visit in our home some time.
Aunt Lucy is well and I believe she is enjoying herself. We are certainly enjoying her every minute.
We had a nice trip to Okla. City on Monday. Cam beck Tuesday. We are planning several other trips. I wish you were here to go along. Give my best regards to your son and love to yourself.

&lt;p&gt;Sunday 2 pm.
Dearest Mamma and all of you,
I was so glad to get your good letter but I thought you seemed a little homesick so though I'd do what I could to cheer you up. Of course by this time you'll have Knox's letter which will at least give you recent news of us. I had a letter from Lucerne a few days ago in which she said she had a letter from Mart saying he was feeling fine and hadn't had a drink since Thanksgiving and was working at the A.P in Milwaukee a few hours a day or whatever time they needed him for.
I thought it was so sweet of you to think of making something for Margaret and I think it would be lovely if you'd piece her a quilt. I'd send you the material and pattern if that wouldn't be too much for you to do. The big day is to be June 9th and between now and then we are all going to be on the move.
Aunt is quite a lot better now up all the time but not able to go yet or do anything.
Friday afternoon John and I went in to see the Patriotic program in which Wayne participated. Then Friday night we (excepting Aunt) all went to Margaret's Box Supper Program and Dance gel in her school. She had real good music donated but she didn't make near as much money this time as she did in October.
he coming marriage is beginning to seem more real all the time. She and her fiancÃ© went toÂ Ousha yesterday to purchase some of their furniture - a living room suite, one chair rug, bed room suite, and dinning room suite (six chairs, table, and buffet). They got so tired that they quit shopping and went to the Orpheum. Bill had the money with which to purchase the furniture and he is also buying teams harness and farm machinery and feed for stock - everything to farm with. He takes possession of the farm the first of March so he will batch until they are married. We are planning on a big wedding - or at least it sounds big to me. John and I are going to get silver like mine for her.
Sure glad to get first hand information from the Mullhollands. Sounds as if they have a real thriving store.
Knox and Wayne first left to go over to Hellers. They have a house pool table and all of them down to the four year old shoot pool.
John has the contract to furnish the gravel for the new Catholic Church. They will haul 400 tons this coming week - all the work is to be donated - the tearing down of the old building and all the hauling and everything that can be done by the men. But they will have an architect design the building. The Hellers donated $1000 besides a lot of work.
Margaret and I are embroidering a lot of things - last week we did a linen luncheon cloth 60x60 and six napkins - and we had just finished a bedroom set consisting of 2 long scarfs and one vanity set and pin cushions and now we are working on another set of pillow cases, dresser scarf, and vanity set.
We have had some terribly cold weather. Last Friday morning the thermometer registered 5 degrees below zero and had been below zero most of the mornings in February. One month from last Friday will be Good Friday too and time to plant spuds. Can you believe it?
Well, I reckon I've written everything. Maybe you've had letters from all by now. Lu is the only one I owe. Let me know if you want me to send the goods fro the quilt.
Much Love,
Bess&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>From: Bess Chandler Roush</category><category>Letter</category><category>To: Jeanette Knox Chandler</category><guid>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1929/02/25/from-bess-chandler-roush-to-jeanette-knox-chandler/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Feb 1929 22:17:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>From: Knox, To: Jeanette Knox Chandler </title><link>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1929/02/19/from-knox-to-jeanette-knox-chandler/</link><dc:creator>admin</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1524" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/postcard-2014-20140626_16212047_0695.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140626_16212047_0695" width="2141" height="3035"&gt; &lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1525" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/postcard-2014-20140626_16210886_0694.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140626_16210886_0694" width="2123" height="3029"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1526" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/postcard-2014-20140626_16223107_0697.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140626_16223107_0697" width="2141" height="1151"&gt;From: Knox, To: Jeanette Knox Chandler

Dearest Mama and Everyone,
Received your letter, Mama, some 3 or 4 days ago, and decided not to let my answer be delayed as long as it was before. Not much news to write, but will try to fill out a page anyway. Here it is, almost the last of this month, and we are having sub zero weather yet. It is now 8:00 PM and the mercury stands at 5 degrees below zero. The warmest part of the day was noon, and it was 6 degrees above then. Our coldest day, so far, has been 30 degrees below. I had my ears slightly frostbitten then but all traces of it has disappeared now. That is the only time I've ever had any part of my anatomy frost-bitten, and I hope it is the last. It isn't pleasant at all. We got a letter from Mart the other day, Oh no, it was from Lou and she said Mart is working extra up in Wisconsin, for the A.P. She also wrote that Mart had abstained from partaking of alcoholic beverages since Thanksgiving which was mighty good news for all of us, and I know that yo will be glad to hear it too, if you haven't hear before this. I sincerely hope he sticks to it. He said that he hadn't the least appetite for it, and was off of it. I can hardly read my own writing, due perhaps, to my aversion to writing letters.
I'd sure love to see Gene, and his parents. He must be getting to be a pretty fair musician, and would love to hear him perform. Will close for now, answer soon.
Love,
Knox&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Envelope Included</category><category>From: Knox</category><category>Letter</category><category>To: Jeanette Knox Chandler</category><guid>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1929/02/19/from-knox-to-jeanette-knox-chandler/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Feb 1929 22:21:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>From: Grace Chandler, To: Jeanette Knox Chandler</title><link>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1929/02/05/from-grace-chandler-to-jeanette-knox-chandler/</link><dc:creator>admin</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140514_18103346_0251.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-691" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140514_18103346_0251.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140514_18103346_0251" width="2357" height="2825"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140514_18102061_0250.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-692" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140514_18102061_0250.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140514_18102061_0250" width="2369" height="2819"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/1929/02/postcard-2014-20140528_18121401_0375.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-853" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/1929/02/postcard-2014-20140528_18121401_0375.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140528_18121401_0375" width="1641" height="1208"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/1929/02/postcard-2014-20140528_18120655_0374.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-854" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/1929/02/postcard-2014-20140528_18120655_0374.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140528_18120655_0374" width="1624" height="1188"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/1929/02/postcard-2014-20140528_18095635_0373.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-851" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/1929/02/postcard-2014-20140528_18095635_0373.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140528_18095635_0373" width="1545" height="1054"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; From: Grace Chandler, To: Jeanette Knox Chandler

Dearest Folks,
Enclosing another of Mama's letters. Didn't you tell Rollin to forward your mail? I thought you told Aunt Bertha to tell him. Started to make my red silk pillow yesterday. It will be awfully pretty. Â  Lorin made a deal yesterday whereby I get my bedroom papers. Picked the paper this a.m. Bid design with orange, lavender, and green leaves and flowers. And it sure will be cheerful looking. Will be not tomorrow. Then will have all the floors repainted by the same fellow. 3 coats and Lorin told him this morning to polychrome my big mirror. So were just coming along fine. Annette started back to school this morning after missing 4 days. But she sure looks frail and pale. Big snow Sunday night. First big snow we've had. Must get my ironing started. How you are all well and enjoying life.
Lovingly,
Grace&lt;/p&gt;
