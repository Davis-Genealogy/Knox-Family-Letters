Indian does forget each other. I remember as long as live. I hate them all except my kids, and if I had my life to lead over again, it wold or maybe there might be a killing fight to do. For I would fight. I show them that was with ring are them. I let them know they are fooling with wrong Indian and there is too much Indian in me. To let them do what they please with me and my kids and I am a relatives of my tribe, are mean Indians and this Indian would sure fight  to kill if any one would come near me to touch me kids, and this woman could be mean. I kill her and kids father. I know - it rong to think of such things but people like these deviles sure wold put a Saint to kill. I got the edcation of world now, and know lots now and sure let her and him who I was. If she was or he was back on reservation the Indians wold they put stop to her and him quick. They&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business not very heavy just now. Don't have very many freight trains. It's getting pretty cold here. Have heavy frosts every night but during day it warms up so don't need a fire. I get the Tribune regularly. Quite a but of surprising news. Didn't think Geo Bixby would get married. Don't see how he is going to support a wife.
How did Ralph make out over stopping no 11 other morning? Gee they sure are strict on this road. Keep the merit and demerit system up all the time. Its called the brown record of discipline. When you get 90 demerits they let you go and no excuses go. I've got 10 for dating a train order 8th month in August instead of writing "August" out in full. Guess I've got them worked off by now though. They make a fellow toe the mark all around. They've eternally got spotters and assistants out on the line watching for every little thing. You can't connect two words together in a train order not dt an "I" with a circle and all the words must be even distance apart. 2nd trick man here got 10 brownies account two words were too close together in a 19. They bring an order around some time and see if you have it on your file and if they don't find it they want tot know why you haven't filed copy of that order. Also send a man over road every month to examine all the operators on books of rules and time card. All the fellows say if you can work for the Southern Pacific you can work for any road in the country. It's not hard work though, or at least it isn't here. Don't have any block wires to contend with. If you haven't got anything for a train just give them the board. Don't ever give the rans here the board though cause we've got a standing slow order for trains in both directions.
Well guess I'll stop and get busy. Got quite a few expense bills tonight. Hows Knox coming? Hope to hear from you all soon.
Lovingly,

her today. That's right Knox. You save all your letters-Ha.
You all needn't worry about the Mexicans hurting me. I've got a Negro gang here and have had ever since I took this camp. Besides all the Mexicans around here are all docile as a lamb. Sure is warm around here. I was in Denison today to do some shopping. Going in again day after tomorrow. Sure hope I get some more mail. Also go in Thursday, so can hold up some niggers checks. They ran off owing me $4.75 in commissary and I want to get it back if I can. The $4.75 will be taken out of my check for next half. I aint get a lick of sense. Think I'll get most of it back though. Saw in today's paper where U.S. was going to buy northern Mexico at cost of $300,000,000.
Hope they do - There would probably be a lot of work going on, building railroads, etc. I'm going to stay until end of May so can get few clothes. I'm plume out of style with the duds I've got. I'll get $5.00 day after tomorrow.
Golly it's sure hot. How's Aunt Sarah and Uncle Jim? If I stay here until May I'll be getting at least $35.00.
That letter from Corbett was all right in a way.
He said if I referred to them they would give same information as service letter would carry but didn't say what kind of information a service letter would carry. That letter was from Herschberger anyway but I'm pretty sure it's OK and will serve OK. when I look for job telegraphing.
Gee Ralph will need his job telegraphing now wont he?
Golly I weigh 140 pounds and never felt better in my life. Wish it wasn't so warm. I've been taking 5 mile walk to Bona and back nearly every night.
By Golly if the children don't write pretty soon I'll not address another letter to them. Knox do you hear that? Now if you want to save up some letters you had better get busy and write.
Is Lucerne going to school in Morrisonville. Gee old Parish sure praises Dr. Thurmon in his paper each week doesn't he?
Gee I'll bet Papa sure is busy now. Wish I was there to take few 31st. If I ever go through Kansas City I'm going get that service letter.
Well guess I'd better close. 8:00 pm now and I want to cool off. All write.
Lovingly,
Martin&lt;/p&gt;
