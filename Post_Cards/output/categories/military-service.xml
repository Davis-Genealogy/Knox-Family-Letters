Dearest Papa, Mama, and All
Haven't had any mail for long while. Last letter I received was when all of you wrote together. Have been expecting mail in every day but none so far. I expect to get a bunch when some does come in. I'm back with the infantry now working radio. Sure was glad to get back. Nothing much new to write. Everything about the same. Having dandy weather. The summer certainly has passed quick. Can hardly realize it is now September. When one has lots of work the time sure flies. I dread the coming winter but this will be the last winter we'll have to put in over here. Of that, I'm sure.
I'm enclosing a letter addressed to members of the "Rainbow Division" telling of our past work. Think it is permissible to send them home.
Have done lots drilling past month and am glad its over. Sure hate to drill. Especially when its so warm.
The allies have been giving the Germs plenty to think about since the 18th of July. Only hope they don't let up on them. Believe me the old U.S.A. will sure look good to me if I ever see it again.
Well I'll have to stop for this time. All of you write as often as you can cause theres nothing I appreciate more than letters from home. Hope this finds all of you as well as it leaves me.
Lovingly,
Martin

Dearest Papa, Mama, and All
Received 3 letters from Papa, and Mama's and Knox's letters closing Grace's and was certainly pleased to get them all. Sure were dandy letters. Also received the cigars from Papa today. Sure enjoyed them. Got several left. That will save my tobacco a little
Intended writing last Friday but kept putting it off. We certainly had a great Thanksgiving dinner. I'll mail you the menu. It's too large to enclose. Hope you all enjoyed Thanksgiving as well as I did as far as the dinner was concerned. I'd rather have been home though. Sure was tickled to get Knox's letter. He does't seem to think much of Papa's hunting abilities. Said Papa had gone hunting and got nothing as usual. Ha. Lordy I'd like to be there and go hunting.
Say I haven't got a pair of skates around there have I? The river is Frozen and I'd like to go skating. Can't buy any this pay day account not getting any pay until January. Didn't get to sign the pay role for some reason or other. Never mind about them though if there isn't a pair there. I'll manage to borrow some skates from some one.
I received the Pike County Republic other day. Get it regularly. Noticed my name in it as one of the boys from Pike in service.
Wonder who is sending me that paper?
Got a dandy letter from Les Wildt other day. Have been corresponding with him ever since you gave me his address.
I get a sweater, 2 pair socks and a helmet from the Red Cross today. Sure are nice but the sweater isn't as good as the one I got from home. I can use them both cause its awful cold out riding each morning. My hands and feet nearly freeze when out riding. I'm going to mail my summer clothes home. Can't take them to France. I've 3 or 4 pair Khaki trousers that would make Knox good hunting clothes to wear over others. Also 4 or 5 suits summer underwear. Haven't room to take care of them. If I'm still in the army next summer I'll get more. Got a baseball sweater that Knox might use too.
Do you remember me telling you some time ago about getting a card from Alabama N.Y. and no signature on it? I just ran across the card today and will enclose it. Perhaps you can figure who sent it. Looks like Tom Blair's writing. Was he in Albany month or so ago?
We had moving pictures here (YMCA) last night of our company out on wire drill. They were good and plain. I wasn't in it. Was in another section 5 miles out when the pictures were being taken.
Glad the girls got their passes ok. Will write them at Morrisonville. Golly I'd give anything to be home Christmas but no chance. Aside from being unable to get a furlough it would take about $50.00 to make the trip. Besides I don't know whether or not we'll be here Christmas. I saw a stencil in orderly room other day marked "Co B 17BSC" port of Embarkation Hoboken, NY but can't tell a great deal about that. Think they just have the stamp on hand ready in case we do go right away.
Well they are putting the lights out to run some movies so must stop. Intended to write more tonight but no light. Everybody write often.
Lots Love,
Martin&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>From: Martin Chandler</category><category>Letter</category><category>Military Service</category><category>To: Elijah H.

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received 2 letters from Papa since last writing and mighty glad to get them. Papa sure does write regularly. I'm feeling better today although still have a bad cold. Received the sweater from Bess today. Gee - It's a dandy letter. Just what I wanted. Came in mighty handy today. T'was awful cold and we were out on a full pack inspection.
Yes Papa we have telegraphing each pm on buzzer. We don't use anything but continental code. Guess I'll be pretty rusty on Morse when I come out. I'll sure be glad when this war is over. I'm getting kinda homesick. Lordy but I'd sure love to spend Christmas at Pearl.
I don't practice visual signaling any more nearly all of the company are qualified so don't have to practice. We have wire drill nearly every day. Also giving as instructions in ciphering. We all have a cipher disc. I don't think we will go over before spring but of course can't tell.
Was on guard Thursday night. Golly it was cold. Do guard duty about every 12 days. Doesn't take long for guard to roll around. Time sure is passing quick for me. Can't realize that I've been in the army 6 months.
2 of the sergeants in our company received commission as first Lieutenants today. Don't know where they will go. Wish they were going to stay with out company. I like them both awfully well.
We have all of our winter clothing now. Good warm clothing. Hows Lucerne coming on the piano?
Was over to YMCA last night. Had Vaudeville and lunch afterwards. Some people by name of Ruinson pay for all this. Have an entertainment and something to eat every Thursday night. Sure is nice of them. All the people through this country are very hospitable. Well can't think of much to write tonight so will close.
Glad to hear you re all well. I'm feeling good expect for cold.
Will write again soon.
Lovingly,
Martin&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Envelope Included</category><category>From: Martin Chandler</category><category>Letter</category><category>Military Service</category><category>To: Elijah H.
