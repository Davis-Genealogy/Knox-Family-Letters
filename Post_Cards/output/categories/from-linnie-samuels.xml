My Dear Friend,
I will now attempt to answer your most esteemed letter which I received Saturday morning. I was very glad to hear from you and that you were thinking of returning to Iowa, and also to hear of your brother. The Riverton young people miss him so much and now they are very lonesome without Miss L. Ellis and mr. Talbott to liven up the parties for they made everything lively when they were about. I am all alone today. Mamma went to Hamburg yesterday and today she has gone over to Mrs. Thompson after some plums and I stayed home to cook dinner for some men that were working here. Brother Joe and Mr. Wes Cowlas came down from Sidney today and they said everybody were well there. Miss Nettie - Among the first you go to visit must be myself. That is, if I do not go off to school before you come.
When you come I will have a party while you are here and have the Sidney and Riverton young folks come and those you know at hamburg. You may bet we will have a fly time while you are with one.
I ask your pardon for not answering sooner for Sunday. I had company all day and yesterday I was making a dress.
Misses Katie and Crissie Thompson started for Lexington, Mo. to attend school and Miss Jennie began to teach school yesterday and they feel very lonesome without thereon during the evening. Jennie teaches in the Riverton school.
It is getting very late and I will have to close with my very best regards to you and all the family.
I remain
Your True Friend

My dear Friend,
I received your welcome letter yesterday and was very much surprised to hear that you were in Sidney and very glad too, but sorry to think I was not at home so you could visit me. I supposed you will be there when I come home Christmas and then we will have a splendid time. I returned to the Convent last Monday and I had written to you but sent it to Pearl, Illinois.
Brother John saw your brother before he left.
I am taking English, Fancy work, Music, and Singing. I was up to River on a week ago Saturday and bid the young people "Goodbye" and they were all very much surprised to hear that I was going away to stay till Christmas. I was very sorry to leave. Don't you think so?
When you see any of our set from Riverton please give them my kindest regards.
Please call on my sister-in-law Mrs. Joe Samuels while you are in Sidney. I know she will be glad to meet you.
Please give my regards to Mrs. Roush and children. I will close.
Love to you.

My Dear Friend -
I will now attempt to answer your most esteemed letter which I received last Wednesday and was very glad to year form you. Mr. Talbot has gone to his home in Ky. and Mr. Ellis is going this week or next.
Mrs. Jackson is going yo give him a party before he goes and I intend to attend it, and you may bet we will have a jolly good time.
The Ladies of the W. F. M. S will give a basket social at the Methodist church this evening.  I do not think I will attend.
Does Mr. Knox think of coming back to this country any more?
If he does you must come with him.
I would like ever so much to have you come and make me a visit this fall if I do not go back to school. Miss Knox I consider you as one of my best friends and will for ever.
I rather think you met Miss Thompson when you were here. She goes with mr. Fred Wricks. He is called "Little Fred."
I am going over to Sidney next week and I am most sure I will see Miss Olive Crumble and I will give her your best regards.
I will bring my letter to a  close.
Much love to you and all
From your true friend,

My Dear Friend,
I received your welcome letter some days ago and I have been over to Sidney the past few days and so I have not had any time to write since I came home.
No. - Mr. Talbot does not intent to return.
Mr. Ellis left last Tuesday, a week from today, I just came up from Hamburg as he got on.
He said to give you and your brother his kindest regards the next time I wrote.
Mrs. Jackson did not give his party as she expected for she had no help.
She was very sorry I saw he Sunday and she and Uncle sends their regards and all the Riverton boys and girls you are acquainted with. I suppose you were out to the "Poor Farm" when you were here! I was there last Saturday
My brother John that lived with us has moved to Riverton, he moved yesterday.
I saw Miss Ellie Cromwell last Thursday and gave her your regards and she sends many in return.
I am going up to Riverton this afternoon so I must close. Please give my regards to all.
From Your Friend,
