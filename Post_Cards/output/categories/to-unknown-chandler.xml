Dear Little Sister,
Got your letter this morning together with Margaret's and was sure glad to get it. By golly I wish you'd all write every day. Hang on to the iron kiddo. It will make a woman out of you. Gee that sure was a whole bunch of tough luck about that earache. Did you try warm milk and Laudanum? That's what Mama used to do for me when I was a kid. You want to read slow on this so it will last longer cause I haven't got time to write very much.
Well sweetheart the strike "haint" going to be pulled off so guess I'll work a while longer.
I sent Margaret 3 Simoleans to buy books. Forgot about her birthday Aug 26 but I'll try and remember March 10th.
Suppose you've been living in joyful anticipation of the coming Monday whence you will again enter the old school house. Well I gotta stop.
Write me right away quick,
Yrs,
Martin&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Date Partially Unknown</category><category>From: Martin Chandler</category><category>Letter</category><category>To: Unknown Chandler</category><guid>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1900/09/03/from-martin-chandler-to-unknown-chandler/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Sep 1900 20:47:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>From: Elijah H., Dave, and J.

Dear Brother,
Yours of the 26 is received. Was glad to hear from you and hear you and all was well. I was sorry to hear of the Death of Mactard Bell Allen but we have all got to Dye some time. That we may be fine forever here after. I truly hope you will have a good time when you get married. I hope you will not have any brake up before the day comes. Well I have some news to write of any importance.
Today is Sunday I just got back from hunting. I got 2 turkeys. Will have a good dinner tomorrow. There is 30 miles of the R.R. done. 40 more will come to precut. Not much mining going on at present. Everybody in good spirit. I think we will have a break in the spring. Will close hopping to hear from you soon.
Goodbye,

Dear Brother,
Yours of April the 27 is received. Was glad to hear from you and hear that all was well. I am not in very good health just at present. I have not been doing anything for two weeks. I have the rheumatism in my knee but it is getting better. Everybody has been under the weather. Hear this spring the weather has been so changeable is the cause I suppose.
Nothing new going on hear at present everything is dull. If the rail road comes it will help some but it is not certain yet whether it will come or not but people seem to think it is a sure thing. Well I wish I had been there to a went to church with you. It had been a long time since I was at church . Well you made a good run at the election. You did not say what you run for. Well as I haven't any news to write I will close. Give my regards to all John and Sasha especially yours truly. Write soon and often as you can.
Goodbye

Dear Brother,
I will write you a few lines past to let you no that I am well and hope this will fin you the same. I haven't any news to write. Times is dull hear at present. The weather is cold and damp. I have been working in the Creek for the last 2 weeks. Done well part of the time. Our rail road has not been built yet. Don't think it will be completed this winter. Our working men are all back in Colorado at present. I don't know whether they will com back this winter or not. I hope not as the winter time is not a good time to look at armies. I had a letter from one of them the last mail. He said if they come it would be soon so I don't no whether they will come or not. There haven't been no girls hear but in town there are some. You bet one to cook that would be way up here. I guess not but my lady neighbor that J. spoke of once before and I have had a spell.
Well as there is no news I will quit. Write soon and after tell john and Sasha I would like to see them.
Goodbye
