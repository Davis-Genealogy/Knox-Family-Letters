&lt;p&gt;Dearest Folks,
Was out of post cards and couldn't write. This is first place I've stopped off since leaving New Orleans. Will be in Houston Friday. Sure am anxious to get there so can get my mail. Would liked to have sent something to you all for Xmas but couldn't. Railroads down here pay pretty good wages but plenty of men will be leaving here pretty soon. This is just small place. Have saw mill here.
Am enclosing a handkerchief for Mama. Wish I could have sent something better for your birthday. Will write again soon. Sure would like to get a job. Hope you are all well.
Love to all,
Martin&lt;/p&gt;

Dearest Folks,
Will write just few lines tonight while have good chance. Nothing new to write. Have received no mail yet. Suppose it will be several months before you can get a letter to me at this address. Requires quite a while to get an answer to a letter.
Have moved since last writing. Would like to tell you of our locations. Things are pretty warm here.
Been having some very nice weather here for past week. Hope it continues.
I've been feeling very good. Get plenty to eat. Have a pretty good YMCA here. Affords a good place to write letters.
Well must close and turn in. Am on K.P. now and have to get up at 4 am.
Hope you are all feeling well.
Will write again soon.
Lovingly,
Martin
P.S. Dont have any of my letters put in "Tribune."&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>From: Martin Chandler</category><category>Letter</category><category>Mentions Military Service</category><category>Partially Date Unknown</category><category>To: Elijah H.
