Dear Ones:-
I'm having such a good time I can't hardly find time to write. I went to Witt and driving yesterday in the car. Grace, Lorin, and Baby also went about 50 miles it was a fine ride. Ruby I do wish you could see this sweet baby. I know but I can't express my thoughts in words. maybe Bess can tell you about her. Has Mamma come him yet? Loin and Grace have a new $200 talking machine. It is a beauty. He will have a new piano up here before long. Ruby I bet you were lonesome without anybody to go with, but Bess will soon be home.
Ruby I like my hat just fine now, but it was almost too large at first until I got the lining put in. I am going to write to Mamma &amp;amp; Freda first as soon as I get through here. I bet Freda is kind of lonesome, has she been down since I've been gone.
I am going to Sunday School tomorrow, it will be children's day.
Loren, Bess, Lucerne, and I had our pictures taken with the baby. Loren got them today they are awful good of all of us. Grace said they were the best Kodak pictures they had eve taken of the baby.
This is all I can think of now.
Lots of love,
Margaret
If you get any letters from Mamma send them on.

Dearest Ruby,
Are you alive or not alive? I never hear from you. Your picture sits on my piano at home so I look at you often. This is my 4th summer term up here. Wish you could be here also. We work hard and have good times just as we used to do. Remember me to your sisters please.

Darling Ruby,
I received your letter yesterday and was oh so glad. Ruby I'm so sorry but I've made arrangements to go up to Springfield that week. If I had got your letter a day sooner I would no have gone up there, for I'm sick to see you and just think, I wrote you some time ago and said I wanted to come and as I did not hear from you for so long I did not know what to think. How I wish you had written sooner and I need would have consented to go up there for I'd rather see you than anybody I know of. I just love you.
What a good time we could have had if I could only come. Say, how long do you get off-as much as two weeks? If so, I'll come over on the Saturday after the New Year's. This is if you have not started back by that time. The girl I'm going to visit up there is coming up with me on the Saturday before New Year's and staying til Tuesday a.m. Say, I'm sending your apron. I sure hope you will like it. I like the handle. Give all my love to all that blessed family of yours. Dear the more I think of it the more I want to be with you all. Wouldn't we be a happy group though? I know you'll have a grand time.
Lovingly your old pal,
Pearl E.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>From: Pearl Ellis</category><category>Postcard</category><category>To: Ruby Chandler</category><guid>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1911/12/22/from-pearl-e-to-ruby-chandler/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 1911 21:57:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>From: Vesa, To: Ruby Chandler</title><link>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1911/08/03/from-vesa-to-ruby-chandler/</link><dc:creator>admin</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/postcard-2014-20140425_18085020_0106.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-407" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/postcard-2014-20140425_18085020_0106.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140425_18085020_0106" width="1051" height="1531"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/postcard-2014-20140425_18085818_0107.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-408" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/postcard-2014-20140425_18085818_0107.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140425_18085818_0107" width="1562" height="1050"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello Ruby,
I found my rooming house but had to think some. The address is 204 W. Mulberry instead of 409.
I have a fine place to room. I have a good time but expect to have a better one after I get better adjusted. I expect you are making big preparations for the pow wow. Don't forget to write  soon kind of an answer as I get anxious to hear from you. Hello to all.

I suppose you are at home enjoying a good rest. I am resting part of the time but 2 hours a day I spend in coaching 2 pupils who have to make up work before school begins. I saw Emma Fay, Lusille, Ruth and Agnes as I was coming home on Friday. On Monday I also saw Anna H. in the auto with "Bill." Remember me to Bess and your sister Grace. Lovingly,
