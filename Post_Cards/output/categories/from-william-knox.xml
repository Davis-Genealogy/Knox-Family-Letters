&lt;p&gt;Dear Sister Nettie,
Yours received. Did think when I wrote that I would come to Sidney today, but give the trip up as I think that Johnnie will come out to Ima soon and we will come down then. I would like to come down so as to congratulate among the boys over the major election but the expense is to much when a person thinks of it. I am now taking my regulars at this hotel. Have been here about two weeks, like the place very well with the exception of the room. It is too small for any use. Have not heard from home since I wrote you. Am expecting a letter soon. Write me at your convenience soon and give me all the Sidney news.
Regards to all inquiring friends.
Your Bro,
Will&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>From: William Knox</category><category>Letter</category><category>To: Jeanette Knox Chandler</category><guid>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1886/11/07/from-william-knox-to-jeanette-knox-chandler-2/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 1886 01:08:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>From: William Knox, To: Jeanette Knox Chandler</title><link>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1886/03/04/from-william-knox-to-jeanette-knox-chandler/</link><dc:creator>admin</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1585" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/postcard-2014-20140707_12391719_0739.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140707_12391719_0739" width="1649" height="2429"&gt; &lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1586" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/postcard-2014-20140707_12392388_0740.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140707_12392388_0740" width="1655" height="983"&gt;From: William Knox, To: Jeanette Knox Chandler

Dear Sister,
On Tuesday evening you spoke about attending the dance at Hanburg on tomorrow evening.
It is a public thing and is hard to tell what kind of crowd will be there and it is safe to say it will not be best and I don't want you to go.
If it was to a "club" or select dance it would be different. I'm thinking there will be none of the best of society there.
Your Bro,

Dear Sister,
If it is not to cold tomorrow you might come over, there is a little oyster supper given by the public school at the Hotel tomorrow night, but I don't think there will be many out, but we can attend anyhow. I can take you back Sunday.
Your Bro,
Will
I heard today of all of you being to Dodge's last evening.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Envelope Included</category><category>From: William Knox</category><category>Letter</category><category>To: Jeanette Knox Chandler</category><guid>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1886/02/04/from-will-to-jeanette-knox-chandler/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 1886 16:40:58 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
