&lt;p&gt;From: Hattie, To: Mill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Aunt Mill
I know we should written sooner but just seemed like we have been so bust with this work all the time and my niece came here right after you were here. She was at the hospital taken treatment and I was there so much and her husband came every weekend and just seemed like there wasn't any end to the different thing I had to see. I know you would like our house and when you come back be sure and come out to see us as we like to have you. I have had lots of house cleaning to do. I am about thru now. Have been washing up all the curtains. I ironed all day yesterday and not thru yet. Sorry that I hadn't let you know I had received the scarf and like it very much and I will inclose a dollar in the letter. Hope you are well and enjoying good health.
Heaps of Love
Write Soon
Hattie&lt;/p&gt;
