&lt;p&gt;Miss Nettie Knox
Sidney - Iowa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pearl May 8, 1886
Dear Nettie, Annie and Family,
Your letter of the 5th received and was glad to hear from you to know of you being all well as this leaves us. I see by your letter and also from Willie's that you are having lots of rain. We are having fine weather here now, not one day since Easter to present plowing or work of dig kind. We had two heavy rains but both came in the night so it did not stop work in the least. Some farmers are done planting. Most about 1/2 done - the corn is coming up fine that is planted and what is looking fine, filled knee height, and fine looking. Fruit is promising all. Only peaches, which are winter killed. Gardens and garden truck look fine. We are having plenty of lettuce and onions coming in now and has been for 8 to 10 days ago. Some growing potatoes look fine 3 to 4 inches high. I do not think that I ever saw such grass or foliage on the trees at this time of year before. We are having delightful weather, as fine as you could wish and even better. The river is falling fast, the water will soon be off the low bottom. Some are now commencing to fill up the bottom, and think they are going to make good crops yet. I have not saw Smith or any of them since I wrote you I learn he is coping in the bottom. As usual he sent me word lately to get him if I could. A bush of broom corn left but I could not get it and sent him word. Lizzie Johnson is still here. Your Ma, Maggie, and her has lots to do. They have a girl called Kate Meginis now for a week helping while they are cleaning house. She is not an expert but does the best she can. Johnie is working on the section with Honan and doing very well. Horan think there never was such a fellow as he is. Still he has to work as other do. I had a letter from Willie same day I got yours. He gave me a full detail of your parties, said he was expecting you over Friday, to stay a day or two. Your Ma is at a loss to know why. You folks are not ready, or could say when you can start or intend to, of course I hate to say any word about your coming. Least Annie does not want too (or cannot make it commence to do so, without great inconvenience.) Hence I am loathe to insist, but it seems to me that the folks, their ought to be getting tired of your lengthy visit. It seems to me that I would not make the folks twice glad, once to see you come and once to see you leave. I do not know that this is the case, but it seems to me you ought to ask sometime.
May 10 I will finish
I went yesterday with Lew Shoustien to visit his folks at Belleview, has a nice time and a pleasant drive, and found Lewis pretty well fixed at home. Has nice property if he had it somewhere to be profitable, but it is like property in Monteguma or Florence , the day has past for such places. I have just got my commission from the governor for Police Magistrate, again, as I was reelected on last election after a big fight - made here by some miracle. Your Ma, Maggie, and Lizzie is having lots to do the last week or so. They have been cleaning house. They had for the last 2 weeks a girl named Kate Meginis helping. She has not much get up about her. We have the house pretty well filled but they keep coming and going, some 5 left today, but there may be 5 or 6 more wanting their place, in a day or two. You must say to Lucy that George is keeping his pants buttoned up and his face washed every day. Our short legged boy is still training so J.W. has better look a little better if he earns that candy.
Yours,
D.Knox&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in letter:
Dear Annie, G.R., and children,
I drop this note there by Nettie's letter. I started to write you folks Saturday but failed to finish. I am not doing much but I am called away by someone every two or three minutes. I write this to say that we are somewhat disappointed and sorry that you seem to be so preoccupied with work so it is somewhat uncertain where you can make a start. Don't think that we are mad or offended at you, we do not want you to do anything to discontent yourself, or that would be a hardship to you, or any of you, of course we would like to see you all and all. But if there is conflicting elements in the way, so as to be a hardship to you we cannot insist, but if you cannot come I think it would be better for Nettie to come as her  lengthy visit must be getting tiresome to you folks. Besides her Ma could find lots for her to do if at home that would be a great help to het as she is pretty well worn out, we had no idea that she would have stayed over half the time she has stayed. But we are all satisfied, supposing you were going to come with her. We are having very fine weather and all things looking fine. We are having lots of garden vegetables such as onions and lettuce, for some 8 or 10 despots. No late word from Izora or folks. All were all at last report. The water is going down nicely, likely will give no more trouble. Tell Bop. that Nettie and Lucy must give him more room, for his back and tell him to grow big so as to whip this boys here when he does come. Of course Lucy is now quite a little lady, so I am fixing up a nice little handkerchief for her when she comes.
Give my best respects to all and believe that I am as ever your Pa
David Knox
Write soon
Smith was here today. All well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in letter:
For Lucy and Johnie -
Dear children,
As I did not get Nettie's letter ready tamale yesterday. I will write you a little letter of your own. I will say to you if your Ma do not bring you down here pretty soon, I will send you a ticket so you can come yourself. Be sure you give your Ma no peace till she comes, I am afraid that Lucy will be so big that she will not know her Grand-Pa and the probability is I might not know you and I doubt whether I would know J.W. at all. Still I kind of think I would know you both. At any rate, I do not want you to be much longer coming least you all get out of my knowledges. Oh, Johnie you ought to see a nice little colt I have got for you to ride when you come, and you can loan it to Sister Lucy to ride once in a while. I know Lucy can borrow her Aunt Maggie's saddle, then she can ride about with George of course, Johnie will be boss of the colt, so Lucy will have to talk up her claim to J.W. but I think we can arrange it when you come. You will need a riding whip too. You may bet we will have a good time. You must write me what you think about it so I will have all fixed up when you get here. Love to you from your Grand-Pa.

Dear Betty and Sister Agnes,
Just a line to you since you are leaving Topeka.
A couple of friends calling here. Could not make out gown and dress so sent it written plainer. I will see the mail man tomorrow. He might make it out. Be sure where ever you go, or whatever you do, Aunt Millie will surely be praying for you.
I am sitting on my porch trying to write these few lines to you both. Had a mild chicken for dinner so did sauté.
Did you sell your home on Harrison St.
Agnes should buy a home from you and Harold for the reasonable price you have made for her.
The card Agnes sent to me on my birthday had no dollar in it as she said she enclosed. I had a grand birthday, looking for nothing but bushels came all the week, I thought I would never recover from the surprise it gave me.
Let me know if you can read this.
Everything looks OK to me but reading and writing. Will try to find someone to read your letters to me. We had an awful winter storm a week ago. I was bringing in a chair from the porch. I looked up at the sky and it was black. Water came through the door between Sandy and one in the shape of a big livey candle. I turned to see where it went. It had wasted it away.
Sandy barked and I let her cuddle. Then another flash came and struck the electric heater. Broke it also heard a long crash.
Sandy barked very loud. No one was home to set light.
Write soon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dearest Aunt Millie,
I have just finished some other writing for Mother and now I have only a few moments. I shall at least write my dear Auntie a few lines and tell you the family news.
Faye Donna, Mister Bert's oldest daughter has a lady babe, born two weeks ago. She weighed seven pounds and is just a darling. Both are doing fine. Besides Bert just ;eft, we always enjoy his Sunday morning visits. Mother is feeling fairly well, not as well as we wish she was but able to be about.
I am joining my beloved in a day or two at Les Moines, Iowa fora two weeks visit then I shall come back to mother for a month or so after then Harold and I plan a trip to eastern coast and a visit to his home in Penna. He called me over long distance last night, says he is just fine. Aunt Millie, he is a darling and I just adore him. He seems just as fond of me.
Bert is doing pretty well in his business and is happy about his grandson.
Louie as you probably knew has returned from Europe, he had a successful trip and is at present in Minnesota.
The weather is and has been very lovely so far this summer.
Mother is not as well as we wish she were but is able to be out in her car. Let us hear from you soon.
I hope this finds you and your little doggie just fine.
Lots of love from both of us,
"Hibly"
Mother says she will write you if she ever regains enough vision.&lt;/p&gt;

My very dear friend,
Some time ago you enclosed a stamped envelope for me to answer one of your letters. I am intending to use it in sending this letter.
For several months I have not been out of my house but yesterday I went out to breakfast and lunch.
Reason: My neighbor wanted me to direct the cutting and make of a dress. She had three and one half yrs of 59 inch material. It was cut all right, now I must watch her fit and make it. She uses a 42 in pattern and then to make about 4 inch allowance.
She has a fine figure for a large woman and wont wear a dress unless she makes it fit to suit her.
She made me a present of a fine new dress for Christmas. It was a dress ordered for a wealthy woman who died before it arrived. The friendship of her and husband for me and my neighbor caused him to give it to her. It was not large enough for her but a perfect fit for me. Navy blue. I will cut a bit off of the belt and enclose it. You will see how nice it fits my butterfly pin. It takes me so long to write with the ink I have.
We have had some very nice rain. San Diego has been called Heaven on earth. Because I did not hear from Celia I did not send her the pictures you sent.
Elsie Janes lives in Beverly Hills now. She was in my Sunday School Infant Class in Columbus. Her name was Elsie Bierbower then. Such a nice little lady then and now. I am sorry this letter looks so.
Love to you always. Now do take care of yourself.
Sincerely yours lovingly,
P.S. Here is a picture of me when I was a widow the first time.
Lovingly yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My very dear friend,
I am sorry you have worried. I do not get out at all but am able to be up and cook for myself. My youngest step son brought me a fine dinner yesterday. mashed potatoes and gravy, roast beef, mixed green salad, steamed squash enough for 2 meals. I inclose a tiny hanky. Not near as pretty as one you sent me. This letter is too heavy for air mail, but you will receive it before Xmas. I am writing without glasses, second sight. Here is an Indian doctor's recipe for improving the sight. Press with the finger 12 counts at the outside of the eye, then 12 counts on the inside of the eye. The other eye too. That helps once every day to keep the eyeballs round and plump. Rubbing the eyeballs flattens the ball. Wash with cold water to strengthen.
On my first husband's marks is carved, "My son is always a gentlemen" - His mother, Dec. 7
His people were Episcopalians but he became a Catholic. Shortly after we married he was baptized. Religion was a great comfort to him. Today is a great Cardinal's birthday. He says he does love his fellow men and would gladly give his life for them.
My home a palace is
And I a queen therein
Mine is all I survey
And none may say to me nay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am in some pain still
Very truly your friend,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy Clarkin
My niece's daughter was married Oct. 15th. Her mother sister's wedding day a Catholic wedding in Delaware.

Dear Aunt Millie,
I read your pretty Christmas card and hope you are well. We are having lots of snow and ice. Expect you are having plenty cold weather up there. I hope you have a prosperous 1937 year. John is not able to work yet. His wrist is sore and stiff yet. He broke his wrist 3 month ago. It takes a long time to heal broken bones. Well Aunt Millie I was surprised other you are 85. I hope you have good health and hope you are not alone out there. You must take good care of yourself. So many people have colds and flu. I was in bed last week with a bad cold. Am feeling lots better now.
You wanted to know, John's full name is: John Benard Thomas Caraher.
When he was confirmed he took Thomas so you see he has 3 Saint's names.
Aunt Millie, we have told John that we are his foster parents over so don't ever mention it in your letters. We may tell him when he gets to be 21 but I don't want I'm to know yet so I know you wont mention it. Aunt Millie don;t you think you will ever get to come out here in Kansas. I expect it would be quite a big trip for me.
I haven't heard from Mabel since Christmas. They were all OK at that time.
Well Aunt Millie you write me when you can. I like to hear from you and hope you keep well.
So I will close for this time with
Love and Kisses
Lovingly your niece,
Mattie and John and Johnnie&lt;/p&gt;

Dear, dear, friend,
I promised you a letter in a few days, but i have been very busy. Three meals a day don't get themselves. Dishes are stacked and washed once a day. Mike usually washes the. He also goes down to his son's house and washes dishes for his daughter-in-law.
She used to say to me when we were first married, 'What have you got to do? Just your little bit of housework?"
I might have asked her the same question but I just smiled. Mike has trained himself into being quite a satisfactory husband. Don't think I would ever take the job of training a husband. Both Mike and Mr. Aubury has good mothers who did quite a satisfactory job of training them.
Wright Aubury was really a saint and his mother a fine woman. She died six days before I married her son, but she wished me to marry him. I am quite sure that Admiral Reeves is a son of one of his cousins.
Wright had two cousins: Wright and Frank Reeves. Who published the Congressional Record about 65 years ago. Wright Reeves had no children and Mr. Aubury lived with him. He was a West Point man. General Grand and his wife visited the Wright Reeves family at their country home in Bladensburg.
Wright talked to him in the garden, the General asked, "Where do you come from." he answered Dutch Flats. Wright said that he thought the Gen. could not be so much because so much gold had been mined at Dutch Flats. Now I don't know myself whether Dutch Flats was in Calif. or Arizona. Tombstone used to be a thriving place. When Wright was 8 yrs. old his father and a law office there. Only one old Chinaman lives there now. Living on $4.00 a month given him by the county. Of course the Commander-in-Chief of the American Navy may be another family of Reeves but he seems to favor Wright in looks. Wright certainly honored his parents. Aug 14 was my 71st birthday. I had quite a little party. Mike's 8 year old grand daughter made her first cake for my birthday. Her mother frosted it with caramel frosting and coconut. It tasted something like butterscotch. The cake itself was light as a feather. apples, cake cookies and cocoa were the refreshments.
Mike's 2 grandchildren wanted to stay all night, but we are too old to have them here too much.
The other children brought me some little gifts, a nice little printed apron and a handkerchief and an English Language jacket. Mr. Clarkin gave me a $1.00 bill.
Do you receive the Household Magazine published by Senator Copper, Topeka, Kansas. He has been mentioned by Nuey Long as a possible candidate for the presidency in 1936. If you are not getting it you should be, as I ordered it sent to you about two weeks ago. I got the news over the radio a little while ago, that the airplanes in which Post and Roger were traveling had crashed and that both were killed. I had a hunch that this trip would prove disastrous and wished that Rogers would not go.
The government is expected to help out with old age pensions. The president has signed the bill for Uncle Sam to help out. It is said that the aged will not be obliged to sign away there bit of property under the new plan. I told you about my brother. He was in O.S.U. Hospital 17 days. He was pretty bad for awhile. The hunting season is on again in California.
There is usually a number of accidents due to carelessly handled guns.
I have thought that Celia might show up in San Diego during the Exposition. If she becomes a public charge she will probably be sent back to Chicago. her children may be as anxious to find her as she is to find them. Poor woman. Her mother was terribly sinned against. Have you ever heard David B. Bush talk over the radio. He is heard here at 9.13 AM. Success talks are his own poetry.
He tells stories of the failures and final success of successful men.
Mike likes corn bread and I make it once a week. It keeps his bowels in good condition.
I am eating home grown bananas. We let them ripen on the plant. The plant dies as the trees or rather plant dies. Mike does not care for them, but the orioles hang nests under the big levels every year.
Write soon and often.
Your Friend with Love,
Lucy Clarkin&lt;/p&gt;
