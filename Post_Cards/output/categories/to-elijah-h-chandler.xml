Dearest Everyone,
Though I'd better write few lines right away as I just had a letter from Bess and Knox saying mama intended to visit me and I wanted to tell her that I've moved again. They transferred me to ward 11, annex 2 Wednesday evening. I didn't even get an examination at general hospital. Guess Mama is there now. Sure will be glad if she can come up. Hope some of you can come up. Hope some of you can come with her. I don't know what they're figuring on doing with me. I feel fine and dandy. I'm afraid my compensation claim will get a set back if the diagnosis made here stands. 'Course I wont care if the diagnosis is correct. Naturally, I'd rather be free from TB than have the pay.
We had good dinner yesterday. I'll enclose the menu. I'm the afternoon a lot of us went to football game, Marquette vs. Ames, Marquette winning 6 to 0. We had passes. I had a notion to ask for pass to come down there for Thanksgiving but when they transferred me Wednesday evening, I didn't have a chance, as the doctor on this ward was gone Thanksgiving day.
I like this ward better than any I've been in so far. Only two beds in each room and the rooms are nice. We ear at Annex 1, only a block away. Eat in general dining room.
Mama when you come up, take the north shore line. Get off at 1st Ave and National Ave. Thats a regular hop on the North Shore line. Then you catch a National Ave. car, which would bring you right up in front of our place. Or else if you'll let me know what time you'll be here, and how you're coming, I'll meet you down town. I don't expect to be here very long. I don't think there's anything wrong with my thyroid gland, and if I haven't got I want to get out.
The American Legion, Wisconsin Department, sent each man here a check for $1 yesterday. There's about 500 here. I squandered mine on a show after the football game.
Russ, I stopped in at journal yesterday. Scott was only man on duty. He said HJD got beat up and was in hospital. That so? He hadn't heard that WS got slugged. He showed me a letter he had written to PDP asking for a raise. Grammatically, it was a farce.
Well, I'm out of paper so will sign off.
Mama, you be sure to let me know when you are coming.
Love to all,
Mart.

My Dear Sir:
Your communication with reference to your daughter, Annie Chandler, received and in reply beg to state we do not think it advisable for her to leave the institution at this time, however if you desire to have her paroled defiantly in order that she may be taken out of the institution and provided for, we will be glad to have you write us to that affect.
By taking the patient home for a few days only, we do not think the reaction is for the benefit of the patient and we will have to respectfully decline your request.
Very truly yours,

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Well guess I'm stuck here until next week - there is a shipment of men going out of here Saturday for Illinois and I tried to get in with them but they said it was full up and said I'd probably get out of here next week - Golly but it makes me sore. Here it is only Wednesday and I'll probably be here until next wednesday. I heard over in germ nay that they were discharging men 24 hours after their arrival in the US. I landed here the 27th and wont be out until about the 14th of this month. I don't see why in the dickens I can't go with that bunch Saturday. This sure is a rotten camp. Don't get hardly anything to eat -I'd like to tell this Newport News bunch just what I think of them.
Don;t do a blessed thing but lay around all day in this darned camp. Lordy - I wish I was home. I get so sore every time I think about staying here another week that I'd like to cuss the whole bunch.
Write me here. Think probably it will reach me before I leave.
I haven't written Grace and Lorin since landing cause I don't know their address. Certainly hope you are all well. Guess I'll be home someday.
Lots of Love,

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all,
Well I'm still in Casual Camp here and from looks of things I'll be here Christmas. Just my darn luck. I wouldn't mind so much if I had my mail and pay. I'd sure love to get my mail. Don't know where we go when we leave here. I've been in Casual Camp almost two months now.
We had our first snow yesterday but didn't snow very long. Having pretty cold weather and theres no place to keep warm except in bed. Got a pretty good barn to sleep in. Lord I sure wish i was on my way.
See in the papers every day about President Wilson. He got quite a reception over here. I'd like to see Paris before I go home. May have a chance to go later on. If we go back to our outfits I don't think will start home before middle of summer.
I've been doing Company's clerical work in Casual Company. Don't have much to do. It rains everyday here. Makes it nice and muddy all the time. I wouldn't mind anything if I could only get my mail. Don't know of anything I'd rather have for Christmas than my mail.
They might possibly ship us home as Casuals in which event we would be home this winter. Hope they do. I'm anxious to find out how Ruby is - no mail since 10th of October. Suppose Margaret Lucerne and Bess will be home for Christmas. Lord It's been a long while since I spent a Christmas at home. Last Christmas I was on the Atlantic. Well I'll make up for last time when I do get back cause I'm sure going to stick around home.
Well must close for this time. Hope this finds all of you well. I'm feeling ok. Will write again soon. Think will find out when we go by Monday.
Lovingly,
Martin

Dearest Folks,
Just couple of lines while in Town. Am still in Casual Camp about 5 kilometers from here. Don't know yet what they are planning to do with us. Am enclosing Christmas and New Years cards. The Cathedral is some shot up but a very pretty building. This is a town about size of Springfield. Sure am anxious to get my mail and pay.
Today is Knox's birthday - wish I could send him something but only have couple francs. Will write you soon.

Dearest Bess,
Received your dandy letter this am and the invitation to Ruby's wedding and sure glad to get them. Only wish I could be there.
We were scheduled to leave yesterday but wont leave until Saturday now on account headquarters haven't got all their stuff loaded. We're sure going across this time though. I'm sorry I haven't had any pictures taken but its too late now. Didn't draw any pay last paw day so I've been broke. We might possibly get paid in Hoboken before leaving there and if we do I'll sure have some taken and have them sent home.
Lordy wish I could be home for Christmas. This will make about 4 Xmas' I've missed at home.
Guess you all have been pretty busy sewing and getting ready for the wedding.
Glad to hear Grove has a good job. Hope he stays with it.
I received Papa's letter last night. Sorry to hear they are going to take off the Helper.
Well Bess don't know a whole lot to write. We haven't any thing to do now except wait for orders to embark. All of our horses and boxes have gone. Sure hope you all enjoy a merry Christmas and happy New Year.
I'd like to have had another one of those angel good cakes before leaving but no chance now. Think they are pretty strict about sending anything to France.
Will write soon as we get over.
Love,
Martin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On back of last page:
Was mistaken about this being the letter which spoke of this instance. It was the letter he wrote before this one to me. When you find it wish you'd send it to me. I want to see what he said about it too.

&lt;p&gt;Dearest Folks,
Didn't send that good as I didnt love the braid. Have sent David Loutcuer, so will send it as soon as I get braid. We are all still busy sewing. Expect to start home next Wednesday.
Lots of love,
Bess&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>From: Bess Chandler</category><category>Letter</category><category>To: Elijah H.
