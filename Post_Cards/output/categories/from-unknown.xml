"Marriage of First Cousins in St. Louis is Annulled
Mrs. Clara G. Howard-Kramer Testifies She and Husband Married in Ignorance of Law.
An annulment was order in Circuit City today of the marriage of Clara G. Howard-Kramer, 18 years old, and Joseph A. Kramer, 22, of 3814 Page Boulevard, on the ground that they were first cousins.
Mrs. Kramer testified that they married in ignorance of the law against first cousins marrying and that as soon as they found this was true they separated. They were married March 4 last."&lt;/p&gt;

Mr. John Roush,
No doubt you will be surprised to get this letter from me, but I thought I would do different from the way you did, and not walk in on you without giving you word of my intention on coming to Dunlap in the near future. That is if nothing happens here to prevent my leaving home, such as something pertaining to Annie. I am sick with worry and humiliation on account of the estrangement of members of our family, and you are the cause of it all. I am coming to Dunlap to make some inquiries about some things I want to know, also to see some of the Masons there, as I intend to inform them of your actions in bringing disgrace and sorrow to a brother Mason and his family, I am also an Eastern Star. I don't want to write letters to them. So will go see them. I do not intend to be there more than a week at the most. And don't expect to enter your home. I am enclosing clipping for your careful perusal. I am still,
Your Aunt&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>From: Unknown</category><category>Letter</category><category>To: John W.

&lt;p&gt;My Dear Gracie,
Not so much fun about that as there was in the beginning of your letter. But then the old era is so darn full of trains tonight, I had to come down and relieve the Opr tonight, while he went to dinner Ha. First my dear I want to mention tomorrow night. This weather one "guy" can't have much luck on a speeder and that way I'd have to come over if I came. So if all is suitable with you I'd rather make it Friday instead of Thurs eve and I'll come on 33 and back on the Chicago train and that way you'll not have to ask me to leave at ten for I'll have to go shortly before. Grace you know those trains are always some last an I'll get to stay until your tired of me. Yes about your friend Mr. Lienhatrdt, I sat with him coming home on 12 Monday. He also told me he was with you at a party other night. made me kinda sore too cause I never get any invitations to the parties. Ha. Yes it was really me he saw on 12 - true I would have enjoyed a couple of days more at home but my dear there is seemingly no rest in sight and I must also add that truly, the most restful periods in my "career" is, when I am spending my evenings with you. And I look forward anxiously to those evenings. I wonder if I will be fortunate enough to spend a few more of them.
Yes! When you mentioned that great subject (candy), seems to me as though I can recall a bet made some weeks ago, where in you were looser? And am counting big on tasting some real good fudge when you make it. Do remember me.
And you are contemplating going to St. Louis eh! Looks like you'd put it off until next Saturday night and let me go along. We will take in a show and look around some. Honest - for I need to do the shopping stunt too.
Here's my trip Saturday- to Maybrew on 15- Marshall on 18 Sunday Slater on 24 Sunday-12 onto Roadhouse and back on 19- 8:30 am - Monday. Had a great time, met some dandy fellows at Marshall, also saw some girl friends. Wish you might have been along for Missouri (Saline County)  is the place for fun. Ask "Jake" will mail this on #15 tomorrow and trust it will reach you in due time also meet your approval.
Let here have a card on 16 dearie if ok for me to come up Friday evening.
Darn if we have been together for 4 months. Save me a kiss too will you? French? Yes.
You going to meet the train - 33? yes. No news here so I will leave it with you. Too bad about Smith. Ha.
All yours,
(Unreadable Scribble)

&lt;p&gt;Dearest,
One of those fascinating letters of L. Chandler. How can you resist it? Hug the girls for me. Am writing a bunch of those. We are having winter here now. Will write a lot next time. Words of love from me.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>From: Unknown</category><category>Postcard</category><category>To: Grace Chandler</category><guid>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1911/07/25/from-unknown-to-grace-chandler-4/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 1911 00:24:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>From: Unknown, To: Ruby Chandler </title><link>https://postcards.vdavis.net/posts/1911/05/08/from-unknown-to-ruby-chandler-4/</link><dc:creator>admin</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140501_18062439_0184.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-556" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140501_18062439_0184.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140501_18062439_0184" width="1501" height="1026"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140501_18063721_0185.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-557" src="https://postcards.vdavis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/postcard-2014-20140501_18063721_0185.jpg" alt="postcard-2014-20140501_18063721_0185" width="1531" height="1013"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
