&lt;p&gt;Miss Nettie Knox
Sidney - Iowa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pearl May 8, 1886
Dear Nettie, Annie and Family,
Your letter of the 5th received and was glad to hear from you to know of you being all well as this leaves us. I see by your letter and also from Willie's that you are having lots of rain. We are having fine weather here now, not one day since Easter to present plowing or work of dig kind. We had two heavy rains but both came in the night so it did not stop work in the least. Some farmers are done planting. Most about 1/2 done - the corn is coming up fine that is planted and what is looking fine, filled knee height, and fine looking. Fruit is promising all. Only peaches, which are winter killed. Gardens and garden truck look fine. We are having plenty of lettuce and onions coming in now and has been for 8 to 10 days ago. Some growing potatoes look fine 3 to 4 inches high. I do not think that I ever saw such grass or foliage on the trees at this time of year before. We are having delightful weather, as fine as you could wish and even better. The river is falling fast, the water will soon be off the low bottom. Some are now commencing to fill up the bottom, and think they are going to make good crops yet. I have not saw Smith or any of them since I wrote you I learn he is coping in the bottom. As usual he sent me word lately to get him if I could. A bush of broom corn left but I could not get it and sent him word. Lizzie Johnson is still here. Your Ma, Maggie, and her has lots to do. They have a girl called Kate Meginis now for a week helping while they are cleaning house. She is not an expert but does the best she can. Johnie is working on the section with Honan and doing very well. Horan think there never was such a fellow as he is. Still he has to work as other do. I had a letter from Willie same day I got yours. He gave me a full detail of your parties, said he was expecting you over Friday, to stay a day or two. Your Ma is at a loss to know why. You folks are not ready, or could say when you can start or intend to, of course I hate to say any word about your coming. Least Annie does not want too (or cannot make it commence to do so, without great inconvenience.) Hence I am loathe to insist, but it seems to me that the folks, their ought to be getting tired of your lengthy visit. It seems to me that I would not make the folks twice glad, once to see you come and once to see you leave. I do not know that this is the case, but it seems to me you ought to ask sometime.
May 10 I will finish
I went yesterday with Lew Shoustien to visit his folks at Belleview, has a nice time and a pleasant drive, and found Lewis pretty well fixed at home. Has nice property if he had it somewhere to be profitable, but it is like property in Monteguma or Florence , the day has past for such places. I have just got my commission from the governor for Police Magistrate, again, as I was reelected on last election after a big fight - made here by some miracle. Your Ma, Maggie, and Lizzie is having lots to do the last week or so. They have been cleaning house. They had for the last 2 weeks a girl named Kate Meginis helping. She has not much get up about her. We have the house pretty well filled but they keep coming and going, some 5 left today, but there may be 5 or 6 more wanting their place, in a day or two. You must say to Lucy that George is keeping his pants buttoned up and his face washed every day. Our short legged boy is still training so J.W. has better look a little better if he earns that candy.
Yours,
D.Knox&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in letter:
Dear Annie, G.R., and children,
I drop this note there by Nettie's letter. I started to write you folks Saturday but failed to finish. I am not doing much but I am called away by someone every two or three minutes. I write this to say that we are somewhat disappointed and sorry that you seem to be so preoccupied with work so it is somewhat uncertain where you can make a start. Don't think that we are mad or offended at you, we do not want you to do anything to discontent yourself, or that would be a hardship to you, or any of you, of course we would like to see you all and all. But if there is conflicting elements in the way, so as to be a hardship to you we cannot insist, but if you cannot come I think it would be better for Nettie to come as her  lengthy visit must be getting tiresome to you folks. Besides her Ma could find lots for her to do if at home that would be a great help to het as she is pretty well worn out, we had no idea that she would have stayed over half the time she has stayed. But we are all satisfied, supposing you were going to come with her. We are having very fine weather and all things looking fine. We are having lots of garden vegetables such as onions and lettuce, for some 8 or 10 despots. No late word from Izora or folks. All were all at last report. The water is going down nicely, likely will give no more trouble. Tell Bop. that Nettie and Lucy must give him more room, for his back and tell him to grow big so as to whip this boys here when he does come. Of course Lucy is now quite a little lady, so I am fixing up a nice little handkerchief for her when she comes.
Give my best respects to all and believe that I am as ever your Pa
David Knox
Write soon
Smith was here today. All well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in letter:
For Lucy and Johnie -
Dear children,
As I did not get Nettie's letter ready tamale yesterday. I will write you a little letter of your own. I will say to you if your Ma do not bring you down here pretty soon, I will send you a ticket so you can come yourself. Be sure you give your Ma no peace till she comes, I am afraid that Lucy will be so big that she will not know her Grand-Pa and the probability is I might not know you and I doubt whether I would know J.W. at all. Still I kind of think I would know you both. At any rate, I do not want you to be much longer coming least you all get out of my knowledges. Oh, Johnie you ought to see a nice little colt I have got for you to ride when you come, and you can loan it to Sister Lucy to ride once in a while. I know Lucy can borrow her Aunt Maggie's saddle, then she can ride about with George of course, Johnie will be boss of the colt, so Lucy will have to talk up her claim to J.W. but I think we can arrange it when you come. You will need a riding whip too. You may bet we will have a good time. You must write me what you think about it so I will have all fixed up when you get here. Love to you from your Grand-Pa.

Dearest Auntie,
It isn't because we forgot you dear that we do not write but I am so busy all the time. This house is so big and always extra work to be done. Bertie comes usually of noon lunch and I try to write Harold every day. He is in Watertown, South Dakota. Mother not very well. She occasionally dries dishes for me but that is about all she can do. Hire very little help. Bert, Louie, and Harold are all pretty well. I keep fair. Hope darling you and your little pet are both all right. Wish you would write us a card.
Love,
Niece Betty

Dear Betty and Sister Agnes,
Just a line to you since you are leaving Topeka.
A couple of friends calling here. Could not make out gown and dress so sent it written plainer. I will see the mail man tomorrow. He might make it out. Be sure where ever you go, or whatever you do, Aunt Millie will surely be praying for you.
I am sitting on my porch trying to write these few lines to you both. Had a mild chicken for dinner so did sauté.
Did you sell your home on Harrison St.
Agnes should buy a home from you and Harold for the reasonable price you have made for her.
The card Agnes sent to me on my birthday had no dollar in it as she said she enclosed. I had a grand birthday, looking for nothing but bushels came all the week, I thought I would never recover from the surprise it gave me.
Let me know if you can read this.
Everything looks OK to me but reading and writing. Will try to find someone to read your letters to me. We had an awful winter storm a week ago. I was bringing in a chair from the porch. I looked up at the sky and it was black. Water came through the door between Sandy and one in the shape of a big livey candle. I turned to see where it went. It had wasted it away.
Sandy barked and I let her cuddle. Then another flash came and struck the electric heater. Broke it also heard a long crash.
Sandy barked very loud. No one was home to set light.
Write soon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dearest Aunt Millie,
We are in a hurry, ready to leave Topeka for Merik Platte Nebraska, Hotel Paumee. Enclosed is a letter Maifer wrote you some time ago. It is almost impossible for her to write as her vision is so bad. She can not read at all. Maifer is going to Merik Platte with me. Shall write you again when hot in such a rush to leave town. Have a four hundred mile drive ahead of us. We hope you are feeling better dear. I am awfully bust all the time. Together with caring for Maifer and this big house it is so much for me. We are all pretty well however. Hope to hear from you, maybe you know some one who will send us a card to The Paumee Htel at Merik Platte Nebraska.
Love from both of us.
Your devoted niece
Betty

&lt;p&gt;Dearest Aunt Millie,
I have just finished some other writing for Mother and now I have only a few moments. I shall at least write my dear Auntie a few lines and tell you the family news.
Faye Donna, Mister Bert's oldest daughter has a lady babe, born two weeks ago. She weighed seven pounds and is just a darling. Both are doing fine. Besides Bert just ;eft, we always enjoy his Sunday morning visits. Mother is feeling fairly well, not as well as we wish she was but able to be about.
I am joining my beloved in a day or two at Les Moines, Iowa fora two weeks visit then I shall come back to mother for a month or so after then Harold and I plan a trip to eastern coast and a visit to his home in Penna. He called me over long distance last night, says he is just fine. Aunt Millie, he is a darling and I just adore him. He seems just as fond of me.
Bert is doing pretty well in his business and is happy about his grandson.
Louie as you probably knew has returned from Europe, he had a successful trip and is at present in Minnesota.
The weather is and has been very lovely so far this summer.
Mother is not as well as we wish she were but is able to be out in her car. Let us hear from you soon.
I hope this finds you and your little doggie just fine.
Lots of love from both of us,
"Hibly"
Mother says she will write you if she ever regains enough vision.&lt;/p&gt;

Dear, dear, dear, friend,
Here I am starting an air mail letter to you. We are having real May weather here now. Some fog and light showers at night. Just now the radio is reporting the crash of an air plane against a mountain top and burning, fatal to all on board.
My neighbor is laid up for repairs. She had a pretty complete Xray. She would like to have me with her all the time but I stay away when I know someone else is there.
Rheumatism and sciatica are bothering me some. Pretty painful if I do not take Iodide of Potash regularly. 1/4 of an ounce in 4 ounce of water. A tablespoon after meals is the regular dose but I take 2 teaspoons twice a day and get along pretty well.
I have not heard from Celia. She has probably joined up with her children. Maybe she and her children are probably leading regular Indian lives and living on fish and pinion nuts.
I heard a number of air planes roaring overhead during the night. Air mail week and not good weather for flying but things may be clearing up.
I am enclosing an Easter Card I mislaid and did not send.
California poppies are out in my yard, very beautiful.
My doctor and my dentist are waiting to finish my job.
I am intending to write to the grand-daughter-in-law of a 91 year old cousin of my mother an air mail letter with a dime for the old man.
Love &amp;amp; much love,
Lucy C. Clarkin
Had a severe stomach and heart attack last night. Bad indigestion.
Am sending Celia an Air Mail letter asking her to write to you.&lt;/p&gt;
