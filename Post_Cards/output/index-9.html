<p>Fri Eve 5:40 P.M.
At Home</p>
<p>Dearest One,
As I feel so lonely this P.M. thought I would write you as I haven't seen you for two or three evenings. That is to converse with you. Sorry it was so that we could not be together last eve. Trusting it will so be I could see you at Sunday School next Lord's day if not before, trust it will be before. Was up past the house last PM. But could not see you - yourself and your sister's family's my sincere heartfelt sympathy in your and their trouble. Trusting the little one will continue to get better. Sorry dear you thought I was mad the eve we were conversing at a distance I sure was not and Margaret I am more than willing to say please a thousand times for you and also do anything I can for to please you.Dearest I will be up by the house at 8 o'clock P.M. and if you can see me a moment would be a pleasure to me. But if not will wait til it is convenient. Trusting you will not think I have advanced a step that I had ought not to of done by writing this.
But dear when I do not get to see you regularly I am lost - I don't know what I will do when you go to the city.
Margaret - take good care of yourself and do not get sick - as I know you are worn out for you was up all night you must retire early this P.M. and get your regular rest.
Will Close

<p>Dear Nettie
I think you will be interested to know that I have completed the quilts as I had planned and they are not bad looking quilts. I had Mrs. Grafford do another one, and she did much better work than on the first. While I put every stitch in the one for Mildred, have added two more on top of match and this will be a real surprise to Pauline, as she was so sure I'd never get her's done. We will spend Christmas day with Milgred and Paul's family.</p>
<p>Lovingly,
Bertha</p>
<p>We are leaving under fair weather so far, and no sickness as far as I know.</p>

<p>Dearest Auntie,
Have promised myself to write you a long letter soon. This is just a forewarner. Hows Uncle? and all the rest. Haven't forgotten any of them. Had a telegram from Ruby saying she got $75 per month and guess someone told you I got a raise too? We're living on EZ street at present.  Papa and Mama went to Pittsfield last Monday.
Love to all

<p>Monday
Dearest Aunt Millie,
Again I say I am sorry because I have waited so long to write. About August 10th I took Meiser to Colorado in order to avoid hay fever season in Kans. In less than a week after that I received a long distance phone call from Harold's doctor in Hearth Platte, Nebraska telling me Harold was seriously ill in hospital with pneumonia. Louie's wife went to Colorado to care for mother and I left Colo. for He. Platte and joined Harold. He was well enough to leave He. Platte in about three weeks. So we left and we came to Kansas City to see this Dr. Jere who operated on Harold five years ago. We were mistaken about Harold being able to make the trip to Kansas City so back to hospital we went again where he remained another two weeks. He is conversating now and Wed. of this week we go to Topeka for three weeks more of rest. Meier is being brought to Topeka today from Colorado. I am well considering every thing I have seen thru this summer.
I do hope dear you are comfortable and that hay fever did not get you down this summer. Also hope your little dog is well and still with you as I know he is company for you.
Bertie is busy as ever. Louie returned from Europe early last spring and will make no more trips abroad til peace is definitely declared over there which I fear is a long ways off.
Weather here now is beautiful but we had a very hot summer as Ks. always does have.
Hope to hear from you soon and that the report of you health will be favorable.
Lots of love from both of us.
Betty &amp; Harold</p>

<p>Dear Aunt Mill
I know we should written sooner but just seemed like we have been so bust with this work all the time and my niece came here right after you were here. She was at the hospital taken treatment and I was there so much and her husband came every weekend and just seemed like there wasn't any end to the different thing I had to see. I know you would like our house and when you come back be sure and come out to see us as we like to have you. I have had lots of house cleaning to do. I am about thru now. Have been washing up all the curtains. I ironed all day yesterday and not thru yet. Sorry that I hadn't let you know I had received the scarf and like it very much and I will inclose a dollar in the letter. Hope you are well and enjoying good health.
Heaps of Love
Write Soon
Hattie</p>

<p>Business not very heavy just now. Don't have very many freight trains. It's getting pretty cold here. Have heavy frosts every night but during day it warms up so don't need a fire. I get the Tribune regularly. Quite a but of surprising news. Didn't think Geo Bixby would get married. Don't see how he is going to support a wife.
How did Ralph make out over stopping no 11 other morning? Gee they sure are strict on this road. Keep the merit and demerit system up all the time. Its called the brown record of discipline. When you get 90 demerits they let you go and no excuses go. I've got 10 for dating a train order 8th month in August instead of writing "August" out in full. Guess I've got them worked off by now though. They make a fellow toe the mark all around. They've eternally got spotters and assistants out on the line watching for every little thing. You can't connect two words together in a train order not dt an "I" with a circle and all the words must be even distance apart. 2nd trick man here got 10 brownies account two words were too close together in a 19. They bring an order around some time and see if you have it on your file and if they don't find it they want tot know why you haven't filed copy of that order. Also send a man over road every month to examine all the operators on books of rules and time card. All the fellows say if you can work for the Southern Pacific you can work for any road in the country. It's not hard work though, or at least it isn't here. Don't have any block wires to contend with. If you haven't got anything for a train just give them the board. Don't ever give the rans here the board though cause we've got a standing slow order for trains in both directions.
Well guess I'll stop and get busy. Got quite a few expense bills tonight. Hows Knox coming? Hope to hear from you all soon.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>
