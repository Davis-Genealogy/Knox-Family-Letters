<p>Dearest Bess:
Recieved your letter today. Been getting mail daily from home lately so the habit of expecting it has become fixed. So if you want to be real considerate of my general welfare keep the daily news stream. Some of the teachers were sating that Sophie Kendrick was going to hold exams in Mafril this year. Will let you know later. What about that London Symphony ticket I loosed my purse strings for your own sake. It's to be 19th April. Better try to come back with Mae and let's study for exams together.
Lots of Love to all,
R.</p>

My Dear Wife
I will write you this morning. This is the first chance I have had to write any. I got here in the after part of last night. Am well and I trust this will find all of you well. I am awful anxious to hear from you but I can not say yet whether I will get to go to Prescalt or not. This being Sunday I have no chance to see any one so I can find out whether they will grant me a pass or not. This is a nice city and the people are very sociable. I am tired from riding on the cars. Did not get to sleep very much until this morning went to bed about three o'clock and sleep till eight. I saw some nice country coming down here and some very rough. It rained from the time I left K City Friday morning until some time in the night and then commenced S. morning and snowed until yesterday evening. There is some snow on the ground here and the mountains are wet with snow. The snow was 14 inches deep in Colorado and I thought some time the train would stop they went so slow. I can't hardly describe how it looked going up the mountains. The train had two heavy engines and they did not go as fast as a man could walk. I will not try to give any further description of the country but will tell you when I come home. If I don't get passed over the A &amp; P I will not go to Prescalt. If I do get them I will telegraph to you so you can write to me. Everything here is high and I can't afford to fool away money trying to dead head my way with train men. I would give any thing if I was with you and the children now. Kiss the children for me. Tell Vinnie I think of her too. I have written to you each morning since I left. I hope you are enjoying your self. I will close and write to you again tomorrow but not until often I find out what I am going to do. I will have to stay here tonight I guess.
Good bye,
From your Loving Husband,
E.H. Chandler</p>

Dear Nettie
Your kind letter of 21st. Just saw and read with great pleasure. I will try to answer this eve. I was in hopes the next letter I got from you I would hear you was going to be for home right away. Well two weeks want be very long to want because I am very anxious to see you. I went to the festival the other night and had a very good time but didn't have any pictures. I am just about sick today and have been for two or three days. I was up till about one o'clock the night of the festival. Then Winslaw woke me at 2:30 to work for him. He came to St. Louis. So I had to work that day and till 12:15 the next night. So I guess that is what the matter with me. The men have had a bad time this pat day. It was raining and many of them were at work. So, the most of them got stuck or usual. This is a fine day and all the men are at work and I am glad of it. I get disgusted with lots of old drunken men. Well, I do wish you had come home in time to have taken  sleigh ride. maybe it will snow again before winter's close. If it doesn't I expect it will snow next winter but I don't like to wait so I'll leave it at that. I am at a loss to know what to write today, nothing worth writing about. Oh, certainly I will excuse you for not answering that letter as you was busy and fixing to come home. But not for anything else. Well I guess I will have to close for want of something to write. But never mind I will pay up when you come home. Yes be sure to let me know when you are coming. I would be happy to come meet you. Hoping to heat from you again soon.
I am Yours Truly,
E.H. Chandler</p>

Dear Nettie,
I just received your kind letter of January 1st and was glad to hear from you. I have been looking for a letter for three or four days. I am sorry your face and hands both broke out like you told me but I hope you will be all right soon. I read one of your letter you wrote to Maggie some time ago about your face being broke out but you did not say anything to me about it before. There is nothing new to write. Good snow on the ground and has been awful cold for the last week. Maggie and Lizzie went sleigh riding today. They went up to Lizzie's mother. They just got back at 6 pm. No I haven't been sleigh riding yet this winter. One reason I have not went was because I did not have a sleigh and don't have such time to look after one. But I expect if you was here I could find time and a sleigh too. Willie is here yet. He lost his pocket book the other day with about 30 dollars in it. That's what I call bad luck. I got a litter from Soruby today. He wanted me to write him a letter of recommend. I did not have time today, will tomorrow. One of the Broker men on the way freight going East this a.m. got both legs cut off. I did not see him as it happened at Roadhouse. Frank Ward was down the other day but he didn't call in to see Lizzie. I guess William has got him done up. Mrs. Laux has moved back to the Cattoye Hatil again, Siul's had their dance new year's eve and had a big drunken fight. We had a show in town today. A man and a bear. The man was leading the bear and about 5 hundred kids after him more or less. No Anthany has not been here for some time. Maynard has gone to Nebraska. They have not done anything about the church house yet. The people of Old Pearl would give up the house out there. There is a petition here in town asking to the trustees to donate 5 hundred dollars of the town money to build a Christian church. The most of the people have signed it. I can't say how it will be fixed. I haven't heard from Phillips since I wrote to you. Only I asked the man where he had gone. He said P. was working at Waun on the I and 5th. Oh no, I don't think you could do anything with me if you was here. I just make the girls fly around. I expect I would do you the same way if you was here. Well, the girls could get away with me now if they knew I was crippled. I fell down on the platform yesterday and hit by back on a plank. It's pretty sore but I did  not tell any of them so they think I am OK. I don't want you to tell Maggie about it. If I had been there new year I bet I could have fixed your hair for you but I guess you have combed it before now. Well I have written all I can think of this p.m. Give my regards to all. And my love to you.
Your's Truly,
E.H. Chandler</p>

Dear Nettie
Your warm, kind letter of love, just received and read with great pleasure. Will now try and answer too. Has been a long time since I heard from you but I hope to see you soon then that will pay for waiting. Mrs. Attwell died last night, funeral service tomorrow at the church house. They have sent for Brother Authey to lead the funeral and have not got any answer yet. I don't know whether he will agree or not. I got a letter from Mr. Weedles today. He said if I thought Jae could do the work I might send him to Sinclair next Tuesday morning. Now I am going to let him try it. If he works a failure I can't help it. Sinclair is a small place and not hardly any thing to do so if he can't get along there he can't anywhere else. Yes Jae and Will Maymard are going with the Well's girls and I think they are both pretty boldly gave. I am all right today. I had the tooth taken out before I received your advice about it. I went to Sailor's Lament  last night at the church house. it was very good. Yes I think you had better write when you will reach Whitehall as a letter might be delayed. The Crusher is not working this week they have a breakdown. There will be a good change for a sleigh ride yet this winter. Although there aint any snow on the ground here but it looks like snowing. Now I have told you all. I love to write to you but hope I won't have to write any other time. Write please, see you soon.
Yours truly,
E.H. Chandler</p>

Mr. E.H. Chandler
My Dearest Friend,
Your most welcome letter received last eve and perused with the greatest of pleasure and now I will try to write a few lines in answer. It seems if you have the same kind of weather there as we have here, I will get to take a sleigh ride with you sure enough if it does not turn warm and thaw the snow off before I get there. It is snowing very fast this am and there is a good deal of snow already on the ground. There is no fear of my changing my mind about coming home for I am only to anxious to get started. I expect I had better  wire you what time I will start. Annie think stat would be best. I am truly sorry to hear of you suffering so much with your tooth. Annie say's for me to tell you that she said for you to have that tooth taken out immediately.  So I guess you had better do so.  I have not received my money from home yet as Maggie said she would send it in next letter. I expect it today or tomorrow. Then after that gets here there is no telling what time I will rack out for home but I should say, rather shortly. I have felt sorry many times because I did not answer that letter of yours because since then, instead of getting two letters from you, I only get one in the same length of time and it seems such along time to wait for one letter comes until I get another from you, but Oh! how nice to think, we will soon see each other and then can talk instead of writing. Not that I tire of writing oh no - I have always found that a pleasure. But it will give me more pleasure still, to see and talk to you. I suppose the fox chase was quite an exciting affair for the people of Peal and other towns. But I fear the next report I hear of it will be that the crowd all stayed at Pearl the most of the night and got drunk and had a general tear up. That is what I expect to hear in next report. Yes - if Johnie had sen there he would also have been in the five and I think Nettie would have been too, if she had been there. Does Joe try to go with anybody? When I was at home the girls (Lizzie and Maggie) said he had been going some with May Hess. But I never seen them together while I was there. That is too bad that Matt Mulligan was so unfortunate as to loose his position as night watch by that explosion. I suppose he can not get a job at the grocery store any more at all. Well I am surprised to hear of Sell Strunk's break, as I was in hopes Sell would change his ways after George's death and after his joining the church but it seems he has failed. Well now I will close. John has just returned from the office and I did not get a letter from Maggie. Write soon.
Yours Lovingly,
Nettie</p>

Dear Nettie,
I just received your kind letter of 16th will try and answer this pm. I was glad to hear from you and to hear you have concluded to come home. Well if you can let me know what day you will start for home. If you come by the way of White Hall let me know what day you will be there and I will meet you in Whitehall and if you should take a notion to come soon other way let me know. I was surprised when Maggie told me the other day that you was coming home. You can imagine about how glad I was but I can't tell you. When you get this letter and are going to start soon. Answer about 2 days before you leave and be sure and say what day you expect to reach Whitehall. Now will not write but a short letter this time but hope to see you soon then I can tell you all. I am busy today. Mae is sick. I guess he has not been at the depot today. Oh, yes we had quite an explosion at the quarry last night or this morning, the powder house exploded. No one hurt as there was no one there but Matt Mulligan and he happened to be out of the way. There was 7 hundred pound went off. It made a big rocket. It woke me up. So you may know it had to be pretty loud. Now will close hoping to hear from you soon.
I am yours truly,
E.H. Chandler</p>
<p>If it's necessary you might let some of us know by where what day you start. But it wont be necessary if you can start a letter one day before you start.
Lovingly yours,
E.H.C.</p>

Dear Nettie,
I received your kind letter yesterday and was glad to hear from you again as I always am. I will try and answer this morning but don't know how I will make it. Nothing to write about. They are going to have a festival at the church house next Friday night. They had a county meeting last night. Everybody is going to the fox chase today. I was glad to hear you are getting all right again. Yes I suppose the Dr. thought you was a good patient. He gave a visiting when he went to see you. I will be glad when your time is out in Iowa. It seems to me like you have been gone 6 years now. I let Maggie read the letter you wrote in answer to the one I told you about falling down on the platform. She liked to have taking a fit about it. I think the snow will go off and spare the sleighing if it don't turn cold pretty soon. This morning looks like a spring morning. Well I will be glad when spring comes again. I am getting tired staying in side so much. When does Johny think he will come home? Yes Nettie your letters are all interesting to me whether they are long or short. I don't think Jae will get a job soon but he could if he was a good operator. Theres a good chance for Operators now on this road. I thought yesterday I would see what Jae would do if he was alone. So I told him when the conductor signed the order to get it corrected. I was out in the passenger room. Jae gave the conductor signature to the order. Then the dispatcher asked him if the train was all ready to go. Jae near made him any answer then asked him again and Jae asked him what he said. Then the dispatcher said where is E. By that time I went in and fixed them up. It seems to me that Jae don't try to learn anything. I have gave him a good chance but I am not going to recumbent him until I know he can do what they want him to do. Jae has made a move on all of the Wells girls. Him and Billy Maynard both go out to Wells. Now they are awful thick. Now I will close for this time. Hopeful to hear from you soon. With all my love to you.
I am yours Truly,
E.H. Chandler</p>
