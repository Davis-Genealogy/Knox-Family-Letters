Miss Nettie Knox,
Dear Nettie pardon my for neglecting you so long but I have not wrote to any one down there but Clara and answered two that I received before we moved. I have worked terrible hard ever since I have been here and have not seen a well day. I have attempted several nights to write some letters but had to give it up and go to bed for I would be so sick and tired. I am just getting over my cold I had when we moved. Ma and I were both just about down for several days after we got here We did not come on out to the country until evening. The day we came I was sick in bed all fore noon after we got to my sister in Randolph. I wanted so bad to go down and see you and Annie before we left but I hd to go down town after we got through cleaning the house or rather sweeping and it was night when I got through my errands and got back home. Oh no to Websters. We took supper there and spent the evening and stayed all night with Sarah Heckel. She put a mustard drop on my chest and it blistered me so the skin peeled off several laters deep. I have not got entirely over my hoarseness yet. I cannot sing to amount to anything. I choke right down in a few words. Well, now I know you will be very much interested in hearing of my ailments. Ma wen down to Randolph today for the first time since we moved. She will stay until Saturday. It seems like she has been gone two or three days now. This is Thursday night and all have retired but me. I have been down to Randolph twice. Went down last Sat. afternoon and stayed until sunday eve. Have been down to my brother Will's three times. Spent the day once. Ma has been down twice. I think that is all. Sister's husband is here. He seen Mr. Roush in Randolph today. When our brother comes back there will be four men to look for. Well I suppose you would like to low how I like my new boarding place. Well I don't like it. I am even worse dissatisfied than I thought I would be. It is so fearful lonely and a regular old nat den. You would think so from the smell that is afloat up stairs. I set rough on rats the next day after we came. I tell you it is quiet now of nights but they will have to hold their noses while they sleep. Say hunney I have my bed in the from room all to my self and I want you to come up and sleep with me and we will tie our toes together again. I was washing my feet since I came here and I lost my string. Now that breaks me all up. Say, what does that mean that I cam cut out for an old mail. I had a letter from Miss Shumick a few days ago and she said for me to look for her any day for she was coming over after me to go home with her. Ma said I could go and you just bet I am. They are going to have a big dance before she goes home. I think she is scheming to have me there as that time her sister has gone to Neb but will be back this month. I dreamed last night I was down to Sidney just kissing everybody right and left and you just better believe I am coming too and that before long. Oh you don't know how bad I do want to come. I am going to have a new negative taken the first time I come and then I will give you a  better picture. Be sure and send yours when you write. I want it so bad. Tell Annie I want to see her and he children and she must have Mr. Roush bring her up here this spring and summer. We will try and have some fun of things on not very nice. Rob will always be ready for fun he just teases Fanney and I most to death. He comes in every meal and asks us girls if we have got some horses tail for dinner. He means horse radish. He is the worst you ever seen. He is always saying something you are not thinking of. Well Nettie I will say good night tonight and talk to you again in the morning.
Well Nettie dinner is ready waiting for the men. I have been ironing all fore noon and am not half through. Will try to pull through after dinner. I have made my new calico dress. It looks real nice. Have done a lot of other sewing besides doing lots of cleaning at the old house. This doesn't seem a bit like home to me it just seems to me all the time I will go down home and find i just as it always was. I dream about home most every night. Well Nettie what all have you been doing since I left? Has any thing new or strange happened? It is just two weeks this evening since we came here bit it seems like two months. I told Fanney yesterday if I could only see one face pass by that I knew I would be delighted How is Dora Ruchardson? the men have come in to dinner and I will have to stop and eat. Well, I have had an envelope packed over a week to you so now I guess I will use it. Please write me a long letter soon.
From yours lovingly, love to all, goodbye
Mary to Nettie</p>

<p>Pearl, April 2, 1886
Dear Nettie, Annie, G.R., and children,
your combined and much esteemed letter of the 30th was received yesterday and would say that we were all very glad to hear from you all and to find by it that you were all favorably well. Excepting Annie whom you say was not as well as she might be. However you say she is better. I hope she will continue to keep so. We all keep very well except bad colds which is exceedingly common now in this locality. Caused no doubt by so many sudden changes. We are having all kinds of weather now. We had fine weather up until 29th night of March. Since then we are having quite heavy snow. It has snowed everyday since part of the time and thawed part. It has snowed all this forenoon. Now about 3 inches deep. Is now stacked up and looks as if the sun might come out and thaw. This snow makes the ground very muddy. I am in hopes these present snows will wind up the winter. Lots was done sowing out there and many was sowing. Labor is progressing here now as much so as any time although this strike is causing considerable excitement at night all the R.R. center and it is not done. Yet it does not effect this road between Chicago and Kansas City. All goes as usual so far, they are not doing any freighting between St. Louis and Kansas City except local between pints. the company has a large force here now, 125 on Quarry and 30 on at Extron. Gang working this side of Stroul, they all say here. No present word from Smith or Igora since my last communication. They are well, as there are parties from Monteguma and surroundings. Every day or two, who reports them well at last. Mrs. Laux still keeps the cottage. They all have about all the men that can keep her house, run the store himself. Jake and her could not agree. Jake kept in the saloons too much to suit. Got wild drink 2 or 3 times. Still Jake is very friendly. When he was at the fair he wanted to have Johnie with him. Johnie had to hide. So had the girls to keep out of the way to get rid of him. Aunt Annie is at Sister Betts for some time. Jim and your aunt Sarah seems to get along better. Jim seems to run the office successfully. It just suits hi. Politics is all the rage nowadays. We have candidates one or 2 each week, looking for county office. The numerous organists of this place are not in as much spirits about organs as they were. I learned a number if not all are going to go back. Just like they were lacking hold because one did others thought they would now. Some are objecting and I learned all are. I knew all would be a hoax. Folks who are not able to buy bread buying organs because they were offered time and again. When any person who was a judge said they were worthless cheap stuff. Your Ma says you must not get too lazy, so as you will be worthless when you come home. The music piece I spoke of is about all played out. The teacher was here last Tuesday none of the whole crowd. Put in a soprano but Maggie and Lula think they were to much at our house of cards. She cannot afford to spend time with 2 or 3. I will close this as I think of no more worth saying in this note. Words to Annie.
Your Pa,
David Knox</p>

Miss Nettie Knox
Dear Sister,
I will now attempt to answer your kind letter which I received on the 20th just and was glad to hear of you all being well as it leaves us all at present.
Well Nett we had a big snow last Sunday night but it is all gone now and nice and warm but the mud is not entirely dried up yet. Well Nett, Mrs. Ella Betts has got a big 9 and 1/2 lb girl born on the 10th. Will be 2 weeks old tomorrow. She is doing well for her country. I think most to well for her own good. Aunt Sarah is up there now. Went up last Friday. They are looking for her back today. Anna never speaks Ella's name. She feels pretty cheap but it don't help her running away any. She is on the street from morning till night. John is still on the section. He hasn't missed a day since he started work. We have about 25 boarders. Now there was 4 new men come yesterday, so we have our house full but oh my I wish we was out of the old place. I have got so tired keeping boarders. I don't know what to do with myself. Nett I haven't got none of my dresses made yet. I just finished Ma's dress last Saturday. I made it myself. Lizzie T just did the cutting. It is made polonaise and skirt with a width of velvet down the front of the skirt and cuffs and collars are velvet.
Lizzie Frazier has been here all week making Lizzie Johnston's black dress. It is awful pretty.
No Frank Williams has not come to see Lizzie yet but he tried to bring her home last Sunday night but Mr. Peters (the auctioneer) got in ahead of him but you bet Lizzie didn't want Peters a bit.
Oh Nett if you could just see Stuart the way he sneaks past the door he never looks in no more than if he knew any one.
Yes you bet when Anna andI go up to Ella's I will write and tell you all the particulars like we will go next week it is just as Anna takes the motion. It don't seem like that Uncle Jim or Aunt Sarah see's her (Anna's) actions but I think I would if it was me I would tame her down a little.
Nett you are always into some development. I think it I was you I would have been ashamed of knocking down poor little Lucy's house after her having it built so nice but that is just like you. I am glad she did smack you in the mouth. Tell her I said for her to smack you again for me for not coming home. Tell her I paid for her to get on the train and come any how and let you stay with your Hill if you can't leave him. I think "Old Saw" is just the name for you. It suits you splendid. Well Nett Mrs. H.S. Groin is getting "pretty large." She is going to St. Louis Thursday. She was down yesterday.
Oh yes Minnie Fulmer and N.S. Lacy was married at Harrick Laudess. I think her parents was opposed to her marrying who she did. Yes I saw Charlie Fulmer over at Dunk Mc's dance the next night after I went up to Izora's. He wanted me to go over to their house but I didnt get to go. Well Nett, it is nearly train time and I will have to close. Will write more next time.
Oh yes Nett, Ma said for you to hurry and answer this letter and send your picture in it and send me Hill's picture.
Be sure and send yours any how.
I remain your sister.
Write soon,
Maggie Knox</p>

Friend Nettie,
I take pleasure in dropping you a few lines. I wrote to you some few days after you went away and mailed the letter to Pearl, but was to late to reach you, but I suppose it was forwarded to you, or at least I heard you got it. I was surprised to think you would not answer it, even you was so far away. You was not so far away but when you got it. Would like for you to write and explain why you didn't answer. I don't like to be treated so. Is your parents opposed to me corresponding with you, or do you not want to yourself. If so, all you got to do, is to say so, and that will close our correspondence at once.
Hoping to hear from you. I will close.
G.C. Hoover
P.S. Excuse fast writing as  am in a hurry.

Well Nett. I thought I write a little this morning before mail time this is an awful cold and blustery day. It is rather curious the kind of weather we are having. Well Nett I'll tell you now about some of the young olfks. Budd Hess is going with Lizzie F but she says she can't think anything of him, but he is better than nobody. As I wont go any more, I went over home with her the other night and she gave me lots of "guff." Well Nett, I take Jen Martin around some, but I do it more to be doing than anything else for it hurts Frazier's folks so bad. Frazier's can't talk enough meanness about her, and it used to be they were the greatest of cronies. Well that is the way it always goes. Lizzie says that Jen thinks she is awful smart because she is going with John Knox. Well I went up last night after Jen to comes to meeting and we come too, but when we came they had postponed it on account of Auction and so you know we didnt had our trip for sighing, would you? Digey is swinging Emma Carter (I guess you new her) pretty high some think they will marry for he goes to see her at least every other night. Well you must be sure and have Annie to come and come soon too. Well we are all up today and hope we may remain so. Well I now ill close for this time. Hoping to hear from you soon.
I am Your Bro,
John H. Knox</p>

Dear Sisiter:
Your most interesting letter received and was quite glad to hear that you are having such a "Mill" of a time. O well go it while your young for when you get old like I am you won't have such a fly time. Well Nett we have been having some awful blustery weather all this month, altho this is a nice day, for the sun is shining nicely, but yesterday it was cold and blowing and snowing all day. Well Nett times are duller here now than ever I seen them since we have been here, they put in a new Crusher, but they can't make it work and they have had to lay off about 50 men. They are only working about 60 now, and you know that makes a big difference but then they are going to put in another one right away and then things will get more lively. Well Nett you must think you have a big "Mountain" instead of a "Hill" the way you talk. O my! as I read your letter it makes me feel- feel- well you know how it makes a fellow feel. Well I'm glad sure you are having a good time for I know you are enjoying yourself and your visit. Well Nett I haven't had a white shirt button or twice since you left so you may know I am growing quite fast, all there has been no place to go to and it is to much trouble for a fellow to fix up maggie &amp; Lizzie are both under the weather, Maggie had a chill yesterday and Liz got up this morning not feeling well, but maybe it wont amount to much. Ma has been doing the work all day by herself, and she is not very stout. Mad seems to think more of 1.00 or 2.00 per week than she does of her health. Lizzie can do the work easy enough if she could only keep her health. Well Nettie, Will never said any thing about that "High elevation of land" he only hinted a little thats all. O well you needn't get your nose up at Bro Will for speaking of him, I know you want it all to say yourself about him but he never said anything bad, he only said that he got sick at College and had to come home, but he knew very quickly what was the matter with him, he thought he had heart disease, for he went to eating pickles right off. . Well pickles is a great remedy, aint they? Well yes. Will said that he was so bad off that he went straight to see you. Euymph my! well hope he is better now, Lizzie F was here yesterday eve and until bedtime. She is coming over tomorrow I think, to make Ma a dress. Well I'll tell her what you said for me to do (to kiss her for you) but then I know it will almost plague me to death to kiss a girl right before her and her looking at me too. But then I'll try it, wouldn't you? Well Nett there is an awful amount of sickness around here. The disease is mostly lung fever. Abbie Dugan is at Sinks and they don't think she can ever get well. It is to bad for that poor girl that she is pretty near always sick. But then she brought big part of this on herself. Sinks had a dance on last Friday night, and she had already been feeling bad and had the doctor to call and see here, about one hour before the dance commenced, and he told her then, that she had symptoms of Lung Fever, but she would be alright if she took care of herself. But she got up (she staying there) and danced all night and consequently this spell. Uncle Jim has gone today to attend his Bro William's funeral (Denny's father). Uncle didn't know that he had been sick until he got notice of his death. Nett we are having a great action going on here now Peter Bro. From Summer "Hill" (not your hill) is in this country on it. and Jim Wheeling, auctioneer, they got good bargains there. It is about to take Flatan's and Meusenbach's life, because they are selling here. Flatten got up a petition asking the citizens to sign it, wanting to charge the auctioneer's $10 per day for the privilege of selling but he failed to get the signers. Well Nett it has been some time since I was at a dance. I never went to Sinks last one, and I don't think with the different crowd from what he has been having that I'll go anymore. Ma says as soon as the weather gets good and folks well, she will give a dance, and then we may have a good one. O you bring that "high elevated plain" and come. I would like to see my new Kinny. Has he got as big a nose as you? if he has I pity him. Well say how do you manage to kiss him. Aint your nose awfully in the way?
Well I've about said all I know of just now, but say you must soon come home, and be sure and bring Annie with you. Now tell her she must come, and if you wait much longer it will be time to make Garden and then I know she wont come, or at least she will think she can't, for she will have so much to do (or that is what they all say). Nett, Schoustein has offered $500 for the use of our house for one year, he wants to move his family here. Pa did talk some of taking him up but I hardly think he will. I wish he would and move away from here for if such a thing should happen as the Crusher stopping he would be left. You need not write back to Pa anything concerning it for he wanted it kept still. But I'll give you the news. Stewart has about quit coming around, O yes Frazier's folks are going to move into Jim Mellon's house (that house that stands on stilts) next week. Don't they have a time moving, if Lizzie was here now I think I could tell her what you told me to do. O my won't it be nice? Well I'll tell her the first time I see her, you can tell that fellow that I said for him to kiss you once for me. Now just only once. But then I know he wont't stop at that, for I don't expect to, would you? Well I wish I was there to go to the ball, but then you and he would make me have heart disease too I'm afraid. Well I'll have to close for I have run out of paper. Well I'll now try to finish up my little little letter, well you may show this to my new Kinny, Mr. Hill, if you wish. Well say can;t you get a picture of his ad send it home for us to see him. I think you could! Well I'll close for this time hoping you are all well.
O I forgot and said something about your nose and you told me not to. Well I forgot. No more now.
Your Bro
John</p>

Dear Sister,
On Tuesday evening you spoke about attending the dance at Hanburg on tomorrow evening.
It is a public thing and is hard to tell what kind of crowd will be there and it is safe to say it will not be best and I don't want you to go.
If it was to a "club" or select dance it would be different. I'm thinking there will be none of the best of society there.
Your Bro,
Will K.</p>

Dear Sister,
I will now write you a few lines, as I am sitting around doing nothing. Tell Nett I thot all the time that I had written the last time but Liz says I have not so now I will try to let you know that I am still alive. Well "Jimett" Willie says you are flying high, well if you hold your head up I know the end of your nose will be high. Nett I guess you will bring him home with you when you come. I judge from the way you are staying that you are waiting for him to return from college. Well Nett I have had lots of fun this winter and then you know, my Old Gal has been staying here and of course I had a good time. Lizzie R has been at our house almost every day this week and she is to be over today (Sunday) to spend the day. I have been invited back there several times but I haven't gone yet and don't intend to go. She said she was going to quit asking me if I didn't soon come. She asked me to go over home with her the other eve. I went as far as the door and came back, she said she thought I was acting awful smart. Oh say did you get many Valentines? I got some horrible ones. Every one that got any thot I sent them, and so they thot they would pay me back but I never sent but two. Maggie has been gone up to Judy's for fur weeks and is not home yet. She was to be home in side of a week when she first went and Smith was here on Tues. and said he would bring her down next day but they have not come yet. Bu we looked for them today. This is a very blustery day. It is blowing snow and the ground is now white.
Stewart still holds the fort but Lizzie's Ma was down the other day and gave her her orders, but he was here last night. I guess Liz wont pay much attention to her. Ira Hanback is here now. He is keeping saloon for Sink. Sink has had 2 dancers this week but they never amounted to much. I was at one of them and the other I didn't go. The two Lizzie's wouldn't go. Well Nett when are you coming home? You must soon come and don't fail to bring Anne with you. Tell her she must come. Well I close for this time. Hoping you are all well. I guess I'll write a little while I am at it and have lots of time.
Well Nett, Maggie hasn't come today. Pas says I'll have to go after her tomorrow as he is getting awful lonesome without her. Lizzie T is here. She came out 11 o'clock. Nett we had 8 chickens for dinner today. "Euymph Golly" did we (or I) have a good time eating old "Yaller lege." "You'd orter" been here.
Nett one of the men that stays here is very sick. He has the Lung Fever and it is very inconvenient for to take care of him. I suppose you have heard of the slanderous reports on Mol Rose and Lansdon. I guess they are all very true but they denied it. They came near being expelled from school but by Nick Smith's influence they were retained. I did hope for some time that they would get it, but I suppose it is now squashed at last for the time being. Well that os all now. Give Anne, G.R, and Children my best wishes,
Yours Muchly,
K
Lizzie T: says for me to kiss her once for you. Of course I wont object.</p>

Dear Sister,
If it is not to cold tomorrow you might come over, there is a little oyster supper given by the public school at the Hotel tomorrow night, but I don't think there will be many out, but we can attend anyhow. I can take you back Sunday.
Your Bro,

Miss Nettie Knox,
Dear Sister, I will endeavor to answer your kind letter which I received on the 22nd and was glad to hear of you all being well. I suppose you have received Pa's letter by this time stating that Ma was sick. She has been very sick ever since last Tuesday morning but today got up and has been up the most of the day but is awful weak. The rest are all well. Have lots of boarders yet. Have about 30. There has been five new gangs come on since I wrote you last. They have about 125 men at work on the bridge and over 100 in the Quarry. They have took out both the little washers and put in one big one. So Pearl is lively now. We have Lizzie and Jennie both wiring for us now and we are going to try and keep them both till after the bridge men leaves.
Well Nettie there was quite an accident happened here on last Thursday evening. There was one of the carpenters on the drive for knocked off by a falling stick from the top and was drowned. They have not got him yet . They shot off Dynamite in the river last Sunday to try to raise him to the top but without success. He belongs in Slator Mo.
Well Nett, Betts has got down to Pearl at last but no Ella has shown up yet. Betts arrived here last Tuesday and sent Anna up to Ella's the next day. She came here last Sunday. Never said a word about Ella. Anna had to borrow Lettie Greathouse's cloak to wear up to Ella's. Did ever you know her to start any place in your life which she had to borrow something to wear?
We had a festival here last Friday night for the benefit of the church. I don't know what they cleared. Lizzie and I went down and stayed till 10 o'clock. Lizzie says she will write to you tonight or tomorrow. She hasn't much time to write on account of Ma being sick. I thought I wasn't going to get your letter answered.
Well Nett, how is Mr. Hill getting along. Scruby is good any more. He is the greatest little crank you ever saw. The King couldn't get along with him but I have made a grand match on a little fellow that boards here but the name of Gamble. He is just as pretty as he can be and dark completed. Him and Scruby is old chums. They went to school together but all the same he is nothing like Scruby.
Well Nett, I should say the bridge does look dangerous. All the draw is taken out. They have a telegraph office down on the bridge same as up her at this office and have 4 big electric lights on the bridge. The lights are beautiful.
We are going to have a dance for the bridge boys here before they leave. Pa told them they could have one. They haven't set any time for it yet. Lizzie Tisazuin and Belle Atkins are as thick as they ever was but Tisazuin's won't speak to Matt on account of Shea's and Jurd's fight. Jurd hasn't got over it yet, his eyes are was black as Char Coal yet.
Well Nett, I wish you would hurry and include when you are coming home. But i don't want you to come till Anna is ready to come with you and Mr. Roush if he can come.
Well Nettie I got a letter from Izora's folks on last Monday to rent them a house of any kind and they would move down immediately as the river is rising so fast. But I could not et an empty house in town for them. Yes, I know she received both yours and Wille's letters and also Willie's photo. She told us about them when she was last down.
Well  Nett I have me another new dress. I will send you a piece of it. I haven't had it made yet. I think it is awful pretty. I got twelve yards so now I can make it up nice.
Well I guess I will close for this time. Will try and answer some next time. With love to all and a good portion for yourself.
I remain your loving sister,
Ruth</p>
