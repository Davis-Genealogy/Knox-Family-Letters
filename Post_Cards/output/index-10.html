Dearest papa mama, and all
Received 2 letters from papa day before yesterday. Awful glad to get them. Was just starting home from club and thought would drop you couple lines right quick. Nothing new to write. Don't know when we will leave. Nobody seems to know. May be here until Christmas and again may leave within the week. We're all prepared to leave immediately. They fixed up the allotment for me today.
You will get 20.00 about 1st of Nov. and each month from then on for 1 year. I wont have 20 myself to send it home now. Seems like it slips through my fingers just as I get it. Hope everybody is well. Am in hurry just now so will stop and write more some other time.
Feeling fine.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

<p>Monday A.M.
Dearest Manca,
I will write just a note at this time and enclose any letters that have come since I wrote last. Bess said she'd write herself today so she can tell you anything I have left out.
Bess came yesterday (Sun.) noon and Papa was at home too so we had a good visit. She looks fine. She brought each of us something new and brought you a new dress which we'll make and send you. I want you to visit until your pass limit and rest assured that perhaps all things wont go to "rack and ruin." Anyway we might get some sewing done for you under stress of your necessity especially while visiting and you know  how much that knowledge of necessity can cause us to accomplish at times so we'll try to get another little package to you before long. I'm sure I appreciate and thank Aunt Annie's kindness in giving you such a fussy dress. That's just like her. I was talking to several down at the soldier's banquet about Uncle's death and they all had praises for Aunt Annie.  Clem Hanback talked as if she Aunt had been her bosom friend.
I'll send you the papers, too. Martin sent his card here for registration as you'll see by his letter. Papa had the garden in perfect condition also the lawn and has poled the beans, latticed the tomato plants and planted radishes. Annie has been all I could wish for the past several days. Love to all.
Lovingly,
Ruby</p>

<p>From: David Kno, To: Annie</p>
<p>To Annie</p>
<p>Dear Annie,
It's true I have not been writing to you much, since Nettie went up there knowing that you had a chance to hear from some of us pretty often. Would say we were sorry to hear of you being somewhat under the weather but hope ere this you are all right. Bad colds are very common now everywhere. The weather being so changeable no doubt is the cause. Your Ma and I have both had colds and Johnie had a fearful cough at night especially. He is now working everyday now on the section with Honan. Seems to like it very well of course. Mr. Honan is a good friend of his which is some difference. Boys must not have sister do too much and he is all the boys. You tell him I am having this boy in training. He says he know he can output him because he don't fall down. We are not getting impatient but ply want to see you a lll. Still more so as the expected time draweth near, I see no reason why George cannot come. It is only awhile spent and we all have to submit to losing time if any of us get sick. Try to get him to come. I like the tone of your last letter. It sounds as though you are coming some time , as I said, no use in waiting to get ready. Maggie is now making the machine work and has been for some days, so she will be in practice and have the machine in good order. Maggie is a machinist . She has just finished a dress for her Ma, Lizzie, and herself by some help from Lizzie F. Se says she will teach you all some new styles after you get here. I I suppose the children will be almost as big as she is, as she does not grow a bit. Still she is real handy to do anything she undertakes to do. I have not had a letter from Willie for some 10 days or more. Suppose he is well. He spoke of having bad colds-this is now a fair day. This after noon, but oh how muddy was the slush and snow. Nettie say you have got very big. That will be some surprise to us to see how having got so fresh. Iowa soil must be healthy for you folks as Nettie looks much fresher than when she left. I mean in her posture. Willie talked some of going west. Do you know anything about it? He merely mentioned that he had some notion to do so, but did not say when or positive about it. I will now close as the evening meal is about here and want to send this out. Respects to you all. Hoping to see you all soon in good health and in good spirits. I am as ever your Pa-

<p>Dear Marie,
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Last night we heard the new "Lucille Love" Waltzes at the picture show where they were showing the "Lucille Love" motion pictures. </span>Say, it is great and makes a wonderful Hesitation. Can't wait until I get to the music store to buy a copy.
Yours in haste,
Bessie</p>
