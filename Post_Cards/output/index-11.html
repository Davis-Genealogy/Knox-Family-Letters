Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
No mail since last writing. Received letter from Bess today dated at Dunlap. Sure was glad to get it. That's letter number 3 received since being here. Nothing new to write, or rather, lots news to write but can't write it. Having lovely weather. Guess Aunt Anna and Ruby are there now. Bess said they were going to meet in K.C. and come to Pearl together.
I'd like to be there myself. Am still batching with other fellows. Like it fine. I'm on a Radio job here. Get Paris and Berlin press each day. Get about 1000 words from Paris relative military situation. German don't put out much news.
I'm getting fleshy on our own cooking. Most meals consist of Ouefs, Pomme de terries, Coffee, Bun de pain, and confiturerie.
You see I'm learning to cook in the French style-Ha. We only have 2 meals a day - one about 10:30 am and one about 5:00 pm. We 5 fellows sure have a great time. At least we enjoy ourselves as much as possible under the existing conditions. Lots singing, joking, etc. Might win myself a home with a little French girl if I could speak and understand French well enough. I get a smile once in a while and then when she starts talking I'm lost so then she gets peeved cause all her words were wasted. Sure is a great life. We have things fixed pretty nice in our radio station. Good bunks, etc.
Dad how goes everything on the "only way"? Did you all get a new schedule yet? They should get a raise by all means. We have a sergeant in charge of this station. Sure is a Prince besides a very efficient man. If I ever get a chance I'll have some pictures taken and send home. Intended doing it before leaving the states. Hows fishing around there? I haven't seen a fish for so long I've forgotten how they look. I've seen a few rabbits over here. Only game I've seen.
Well, must close and get supper. All of you write often.
Am feeling great. Hope you are all well.
Love,
Martin

Dearest papa, mama, and all
Have had no chance to write for some time. Received 1 letter from papa and one from Grace and Lorin about 10 days ago. Was surely glad to get them and to know you are all well. They were both dated 2/5. Twas first and only mail I've received since being over here. Haven't received the package tobacco papa sent. It will come in mighty handy cause I haven't been paid for about 6 months and they haven't yet received my service record so don't know when I'll get paid except will get my service record this month, however.
Are you getting the allotment regularly and did the government add anything? Well I passed a rather different Easter than I generally do. Will certainly remember next Easter where I passed this one. Can't tell you half that I'd like to. Do you hear often from Ruby and Sam? I wrote them some time ago. Will write Grace, Lorin, and Lucerne tonight - Grace promises me Audrey's picture for the asking and I sure want it. Seems that I've been away from home for ages. I will be 3 years next Dec. 12th. Have lots of real interesting work to do over here. Time just flies. We're having warm weather. A little rainy but think it will clean up soon. Suppose school is just about ended there for this term isn't it? How's Knox getting along? Suppose everything is very high there. Do you have much trouble getting coal and wood?
5 of us have been drawing rations and doing out own cooking past few days account being located quite a distance from the kitchen. Like it fine and dandy. Suppose you read each day of the doings on the Semme and know how things are going. We get the paris edition of the New York Herald here. I don't have much luck getting news out of a French paper. I can't speak much French. It's a hard language to learn.
Well must close for this time. Will write as often as can. Hope this finds you all well.
Lovingly,
Martin
If you send any tobacco select "Bull Durham." Don't hand any letters to the paper.</p>

Dearest Folks,
Will write just few lines tonight while have good chance. Nothing new to write. Have received no mail yet. Suppose it will be several months before you can get a letter to me at this address. Requires quite a while to get an answer to a letter.
Have moved since last writing. Would like to tell you of our locations. Things are pretty warm here.
Been having some very nice weather here for past week. Hope it continues.
I've been feeling very good. Get plenty to eat. Have a pretty good YMCA here. Affords a good place to write letters.
Well must close and turn in. Am on K.P. now and have to get up at 4 am.
Hope you are all feeling well.
Will write again soon.
Lovingly,
Martin
P.S. Dont have any of my letters put in "Tribune."</p>

<p>Dearest Folks,
Have been traveling about quite a bit since last writing you. Was transferred to the 117th F.B.S.C. Feb 12. Like the organization very well and if I had my mail, clothes, etc from the 1st FB would just as soon stay with this organization. My service record is still with my old company. Don't know when I'll get a pay. Haven't received any pay since October. Would like very much to get the mail you've already sent to me at 1st FB. But don't know whether or not it will be forwarded here.
Been having some very rainy weather the past week. Guess this is the rainy season. First I've seen since being over here.
Would like to tell you of our whereabouts but of course that's forbidden.
Am feeling very good. Only hope you are all feeling as well. Must stop for this time. Will write again soon.
Lovingly,
Martin

<p>Dearest Papa, Mama, and All
Received letter from Papa yesterday and sure glad to get it. I've been working 2nd trick for last 2 days. 2nd trick man laid off and man they sent to relieve him couldn't handle 2nd account so much clerical work to do. Don't think he can handle 3rd either. Agent wired them that he was putting me on 2nd. Gee I have lots of clerical work to do. Have at least 10 car loads of wood, ore, and apples, each day. Ore all goes to Niagara Falls. Costs $750.00 per car to ship it. Have both Ford and Reed abstracts to make out, damage reports, write up freight bulls in cash book, have to make out Western Union and Tuckit report at end of month. Work from 4 pm to 12 but generally come to work at noon. Came over at noon today and made out ticket report and Western Union up to date. So wouldn't have so much to do tomorrow. I'll be on this job for about a week longer and when regular 2nd tick man comes back agent said he would see that I got the 3rd trick back. He came over to hotel and awakened me and asked if I would work 2nd trick. I like the job OK. Get lots of good sleep now. I have 3 passenger trains to sell tickets for  and both locals and 2 regular freight trains on this trick but don't have to get outside of office. Local conductors unload freight and wheel it in warehouse and seal cars and baggage boy handle the passenger trains and check baggage. All I have to do is make out switch lists and clear them. Have quite a few orders but not as many on 3rd trick. Both locals get along between 10 and 11 pm.
Only thing I don't like about this job is having to work evenings. I've been going up to see a bunch of school teachers every night and have lots of fun. Two of them are Catholic and I get into some awful arguments with them some times. All nice girls though. Always have some candy made or a bunch of fruit. Have a swell Victrola and two of them play the piano.
How's Knox getting along in school? Is Uncle Jim any better? Hope Aunt Sarah is ok.
Well must stop and get busy. Hope you all write soon. Lucerne I haven't heard from you for a long while. Guess Hipockets is waiting till he learns to spell before he writes. Ha. Will write again soon.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dearest Folks,
Intended writing yesterday but out it off until today.
Will leave hospital tomorrow but probably wont join my company for a month. Will go from here to convalescent camp and will be there 2 weeks and then go to base where will remain while longer so guess I wont get any mail for some time yet as all my mail will be with company. I haven't had any pay for 2 months. Guess wont get any until I join company. I'm dead broke too but guess wont have much use for money for while anyway. I'll have about 40.00 when</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received letter from Papa day before yesterday dated Jan. 1st and very glad to get it and to know everybody is well. Was very anxious to know that Mama and Anna had recovered from the attack of influenza. Think I mentioned in a previous letter that I had received a bunch of my back mail including letters from Ruby, Grace, and Lorin.
Not very much news to write. Persistent rumors indicate that we will leave next month. Most of the rumors sound very plausible and I'm beginning to put a little faith in them. Certainly would love to get home. I'm still on the same job. Business has been rather heavy last few days. Was notified few days ago that I would attend Liaison School at Coblens but have heard nothing definite about it since so don't know whether or not I'll go. Hope so anyway.
The people here are as cordial as ever. They don't seem to be suffering in the least. All the families I've seen so far have had plenty of food. I ate supper with a German family (Place where I room) other night and they had roast pork, something I hadn't tasted for a year.
Has been pretty cold last few days. Has snowed several times lately but not heavily.
Having quite a bit of entertainment through the Red Cross, K of C and YMCA shoes have been pretty good. The 2nd Canadian Division met the 42nd (Rainbow) Division in an athletic contest short time ago. We won the meet by quite a margin. I attended the boxing bouts. We won 5 out of the 6 matches, scoring two knockouts. Had a very large attendance.
Well must close for this time. Want to write to Grace tonight. Wrote to girls at Wichita several days ago.
Hope this finds you all well. I'm feeling fine and dandy. Write often.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dearest Grace and all,
has been some time since I've written so thought I'd write few lines this pm while nothing to do.
Had a pleasant voyage across the Atlantic. Was on the water Christmas and New Years.
Am in the Hospital here now with measles. Come in the 15th. Am getting along OK and feel good.
Hows Audrey getting along? My I'd love to see her as well as rest of you. It hasn't been very cold here past 10 days, but has rained considerably.
I expect to join my company in about a week.
Well I can't say very much so will close. Be sure and write soon as you can. Hope you are all feeling well.
Lovingly,
Martin
