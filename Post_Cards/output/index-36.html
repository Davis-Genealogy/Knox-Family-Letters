Dearest Folks,
Have received 2 letters from Papa since last writing. Guess you'll think I've quit writing altogether. I've written twice. But as usual didn't mail them. They weren't very long letters anyway. Just a note.
Have been working like the dickens past week. It has snowed every day. Now 8:30 pm and we just got through loading our combat wagons, trucks, motorcycles, and other boxes and will load the horses tomorrow and leave Tuesday for sure so you needn't write me anymore until you hear from me again. Needn't mention to anyone that we have gone.
Will write you as often as possible from over there but don't expect any descriptions of country, etc cause it isn't allowed.
Got letter from Chas Morgan at St. Louis other day. It was in the dead letter office for some time account he didn't put my organization on envelope. Will enclose it. Today is Knox's birthday. Wish I had something to send. I'm broke cause didn't draw any pay this month.
I haven't read the insurance policy yet. Guess they will mail it direct to you. I changed my mind and made it for $10,000.00 in case I did you will get about $58.00 per month for 20 years andÂ in case of death of beneficiary it goes to next closest relative and sundown until it is all paid. Again if I should be disabled I would receive a pretty nice income. It goes $6.50 per month on $10,000.00. That will leave me about 3.00 per month which I think will be all I'll need. Did you ever hear in regard to increase on my allotment? Sure hope you get it.
I'm feeling fine and have plenty of warm clothing and will make it OK so don't worry about me. We have a dandy Captain. He is always looking out for our health and comfort.
Well I'll stop and turn in cause I'm sure tired.
Here's wishing everybody a merry merry Christmas and Happy New Years and hope I'll be with you on the next Xmas.
Knox here's best wishes for a happy birthday and hope I'll see a big strapping fellow when I get back.
Will let you hear from me soon as can.
Lots love to all,
Martin</p>

<p>Dear Martin,
I have been reading your letters to the Tribune and have been much impressed by them and could constrain myself no longer from writing you a few lines of commendation. I am much gratified to know that some of the Pearl boys are "doing their bit," and a little more. I have, however, not much to say for myself, as I am not in active military service, but, believe me I do my share of moral support, such as proclaiming my american spirit, buying liberty bonds, etc. I did however, apply for Army Officers Reserve, but was unfortunate in that, a german letter carrier failed to deliver my first appointment in time (he is now out of service, you may be assured), the second comp you know, demanded a higher standard of men. Consequently, I did not make it. I was too young and had no military service.
As I am already in one branch of government service and have been attending a university here the past to years, I have hesitated to join as a private, I shall when I am really needed.
Well, Martin, I have used much ink in weakly justifying myself for not being in active service, but I am firmly convinced that every able bodied young man who is not in military, should have reasons as good or even better than I have.
There are many Germans in St. Louis, which affords many opportunities for one to express his patriotism.
I heard that your sisters were down here some time back, but I did not get to see them. I rarely see any one from Pearl. My brother Ray is staying with me now.
I hope you have an excellent Thanksgiving. I am sure I shall have.
We, university students have a big turkey supper on Wednesday, then a big "pep" parade! Shirt-tails out, etc. Big football game between our school and St. Louis University Thursday. I shall be there. I still feel like a high-school boy of 18, even thought I am over 25 but that is not old for University. Martin there is nothing better than school days, that is one reason I am having so many of them.
I suppose you know Martin Schlepper and his sister. They are here. Martin is out with us (at the Washington U.) and his sister is going to Brown's Business College. Fine boy is Martin.
Well Martin if you find a moment to spare when writing to your friend, let me have a line or so.
Wishing you rapid promotion, and the very best of luck, I Â am ever,
Your Friend
Morgan, Chas E.</p>

Mrs. E.H. Chandler,
Dearest Aunt and all,
Thought I would drop you a few lines to let you know I was still in the land of living. I have been here two months. Sent here from Detroit , Mich. for Stone and Webster. I am working for Audy Carnegie as Master Mechanic over the gas engine and sram shovels. Drawing $300.00 per month. We are building a large steel mill here ad a neighborhood of 1400 houses. Most all of my work is in gas engines. Now aunt Nett, I want you to write me all the news and I want the girls to write also. Where is Martin at now? Suppose Ruby and Sam is married. Now how is Uncle Elijah? Tell him not to be backwards. Might ship me a line. Would sure appreciate it. I will leave her for Philadelphia the first of the year, building a ship yard. Though would like to hear from you all soon for there is nothing so cheery as a letter from home. How is Aunt Sarrah and what did Grace name the Babe? Don't know anything more to write.
Your Nephew

Dearest Folks,
I guess we'll get there Saturday noon-sooner if we can. Want to get back Friday if possible. It has been awfully cold the whole week-as I suppose you know. December 24 will be an eventful day. We have been doing a good deal but get up so late Ma keeps the day so short. We've been wondering what you heard from Aunt Annie. Christmas is sure awfully near! Hope everybody is well. Lucille, I got some music you'll like. So you can practice to your heart's content on Sunday. We went to shake last night. Made fudge and popcorn. Grace has a new coat. Pretty!
Love to all,
Ruby</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received Mama's letter today and was nightly tickled to get it. Mama always writes long news letters. Just wrote night before last so don't know much to write. I will fill out appreciation blank for Insurance tomorrow for $5000.00. It will cost $3.30 per month. I don't like the way they pay it but can't help it. It's this way. If I get killed you will get the $5000.00 at so much per month for 20 years but in Papa's case I think they will make the payments larger and less time. $5000.00 would be about $25.00 per month for 20 years. It doesn't pay anything for Partial Disability but pays considerable for Total Disability. They have another Compensation Act which provides for Partial and Total Disability. It's put up by the government and doesn't cost us anything. So in case I should be totally disabled I would receive quite a bit per month. Will have them send the policy to you.
Mama I sure hope your fruit cake pans out all right cause I'd sure like to have a piece.
Still pretty cold here. Don't know yet when we will leave but think pretty soon.
Think they are figuring on motorizing this company. Hope so anyway. We will have Motor Cycles then instead of horses.
Well don't know anymore to write just now so will stop. Everybody keep on writing often.
Lots Love,
Martin</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and All
Received 3 letters from Papa, and Mama's and Knox's letters closing Grace's and was certainly pleased to get them all. Sure were dandy letters. Also received the cigars from Papa today. Sure enjoyed them. Got several left. That will save my tobacco a little
Intended writing last Friday but kept putting it off. We certainly had a great Thanksgiving dinner. I'll mail you the menu. It's too large to enclose. Hope you all enjoyed Thanksgiving as well as I did as far as the dinner was concerned. I'd rather have been home though. Sure was tickled to get Knox's letter. He does't seem to think much of Papa's hunting abilities. Said Papa had gone hunting and got nothing as usual. Ha. Lordy I'd like to be there and go hunting.
Say I haven't got a pair of skates around there have I? The river is Frozen and I'd like to go skating. Can't buy any this pay day account not getting any pay until January. Didn't get to sign the pay role for some reason or other. Never mind about them though if there isn't a pair there. I'll manage to borrow some skates from some one.
I received the Pike County Republic other day. Get it regularly. Noticed my name in it as one of the boys from Pike in service.
Wonder who is sending me that paper?
Got a dandy letter from Les Wildt other day. Have been corresponding with him ever since you gave me his address.
I get a sweater, 2 pair socks and a helmet from the Red Cross today. Sure are nice but the sweater isn't as good as the one I got from home. I can use them both cause its awful cold out riding each morning. My hands and feet nearly freeze when out riding. I'm going to mail my summer clothes home. Can't take them to France. I've 3 or 4 pair Khaki trousers that would make Knox good hunting clothes to wear over others. Also 4 or 5 suits summer underwear. Haven't room to take care of them. If I'm still in the army next summer I'll get more. Got a baseball sweater that Knox might use too.
Do you remember me telling you some time ago about getting a card from Alabama N.Y. and no signature on it? I just ran across the card today and will enclose it. Perhaps you can figure who sent it. Looks like Tom Blair's writing. Was he in Albany month or so ago?
We had moving pictures here (YMCA) last night of our company out on wire drill. They were good and plain. I wasn't in it. Was in another section 5 miles out when the pictures were being taken.
Glad the girls got their passes ok. Will write them at Morrisonville. Golly I'd give anything to be home Christmas but no chance. Aside from being unable to get a furlough it would take about $50.00 to make the trip. Besides I don't know whether or not we'll be here Christmas. I saw a stencil in orderly room other day marked "Co B 17BSC" port of Embarkation Hoboken, NY but can't tell a great deal about that. Think they just have the stamp on hand ready in case we do go right away.
Well they are putting the lights out to run some movies so must stop. Intended to write more tonight but no light. Everybody write often.
Lots Love,
Martin</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received 2 letters from Papa since last writing and mighty glad to get them. Papa sure does write regularly. I'm feeling better today although still have a bad cold. Received the sweater from Bess today. Gee - It's a dandy letter. Just what I wanted. Came in mighty handy today. T'was awful cold and we were out on a full pack inspection.
Yes Papa we have telegraphing each pm on buzzer. We don't use anything but continental code. Guess I'll be pretty rusty on Morse when I come out. I'll sure be glad when this war is over. I'm getting kinda homesick. Lordy but I'd sure love to spend Christmas at Pearl.
I don't practice visual signaling any more nearly all of the company are qualified so don't have to practice. We have wire drill nearly every day. Also giving as instructions in ciphering. We all have a cipher disc. I don't think we will go over before spring but of course can't tell.
Was on guard Thursday night. Golly it was cold. Do guard duty about every 12 days. Doesn't take long for guard to roll around. Time sure is passing quick for me. Can't realize that I've been in the army 6 months.
2 of the sergeants in our company received commission as firstÂ Lieutenants today. Don't know where they will go. Wish they were going to stay with out company. I like them both awfully well.
We have all of our winter clothing now. Good warm clothing. Hows Lucerne coming on the piano?
Was over to YMCA last night. Had Vaudeville and lunch afterwards. Some people by name of Ruinson pay for all this. Have an entertainment and something to eat every Thursday night. Sure is nice of them. All the people through this country are very hospitable. Well can't think of much to write tonight so will close.
Glad to hear you re all well. I'm feeling good expect for cold.
Will write again soon.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dearest Margaret,
Received your letter some time ago and sure glad to get it. Wish you'd write often. Hows school coming? Guess you're having a great time playing basket ball. Gee it will soon be Christmas. Seems an age since I've spent an Xmas at home. Sure hope I'll be at home some Christmas. Don't know where I'll be this Christmas. Kinda looks as thought we were going to leave before soon. But can't tell much about it. Didn't expect to be here now.
Sure is cold here. Having lots rain too. Makes it awful disagreeable. I'm sure having a peach of a time in the kitchen. Lots of work to do. Get up at 5:30 am and work until 6:30 pm. Wash dishes, pans, peel spuds, onions, and do a little bit of everything. Carry coal and cut wood each day. I'll be off tomorrow night and I'll sure be glad of it.
Wrote Bess last night and put a 2 cent stamp on it so guess she will have to pay a penny to get it out. Didn't think about having to put 3 cent on it.
When are you going to Morrisonville? How is Audrey? Golly Id sure love to see her and the rest of you all.
Well I don't know anything to write tonight so will stop.
Be sure and write as often as you can cause I sure love to get the letters.
Hope everybody is well.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>
