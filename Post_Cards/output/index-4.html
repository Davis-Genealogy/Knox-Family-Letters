<p>Dear Sister Nettie,
Yours received. Did think when I wrote that I would come to Sidney today, but give the trip up as I think that Johnnie will come out to Ima soon and we will come down then. I would like to come down so as to congratulate among the boys over the major election but the expense is to much when a person thinks of it. I am now taking my regulars at this hotel. Have been here about two weeks, like the place very well with the exception of the room. It is too small for any use. Have not heard from home since I wrote you. Am expecting a letter soon. Write me at your convenience soon and give me all the Sidney news.
Regards to all inquiring friends.
Your Bro,
Will</p>

Dear Nettie,
I will not try and answer your kind letter that I received today. I had been looking for a letter two or three days. I should have written to you yesterday only I knew I had 2 or 3 letters that were not answered yet and thought I would wait one day more. The Methodist are holding a protected meeting now. I have been going all the time 'til tonight. Thought I would rather stay at home and write to you than to go to Church as I find more pleasure writing to you than anything else while I cannot be with you. I don't want you to get mad about the short letter I wrote you today. I did not have time to write any. I wanted to get a letter started as soon as possible so I could hear from you again that much sooner. A week seems like a  month to me when I don't hear from you. I took a message this evening from Sidney to your Pa, when the Just Commenced Spelling Sydney. I was awful anxious to hear what it was going to be there. Was a thousand thoughts in my head. I was afraid somebody was sick. I was glad when I heard that it was about the Election. Your Pa is in Pittsfield on the grand jury. I forwarded the telegram to him at Pittsfield there. I bought a copy for our house and gave it to Maggy. She flew around the table to get it. When I told her it was from Sidney she said she would bet you was coming. Had then the thought it was from Willie. No I did not know Lizzie H. had to set up while Ian was there. They have not got any stove up yet. Ian was down last Sunday about knowing whether he stayed all night or not. Did you hear about Frageus Boby dying. It died last Friday, I think. very body has have election on the Bra for the last week. I am glad it is over now. The Eutrise Democratic ticket was elected in the county.
Yes Nettie I wish I could have been there last Sunday night. I can't think of any thing that would be more enjoyment for me than to be with you. I think of you every time I come to the house and many many other times. I think more of you every time I hear from you. Seems to me like because I think you mean what you say. Yes, I know you do. I don't think you could have any object in being false. Nettie I will tell you again that I never had half as much confidence in any one as I have in you and while I have I assure you that I will never give you any room to complain. I will be awful glad when I get the hat work you are making. Wish you would come with it and fit in my hat. Do you remember the heart you sewed in my hat once. There is a big difference now, you know time. Some time changes mind but not in all cases. I know nothing will ever change my mind in regard to you. Do you remember about George Aker's wife dying just a short time before you left. I understand he is going to get married tomorrow to May Miller. I think he is in a hurry, don't you? I am getting cold now. I will close for tonight. Hope will hear from soon.
Yours Truly,
E.H. Chandler
I wish you was here Nettie</p>

Dear Nettie,
Your very kind letter just received but not before I was looking for it. I think it has been a week today since I got a letter from you. I will try to write you a few lines today so can send it off on this eve train. I have so awful much to do today I can not write much but will finish tonight. I don't know how I would pass the time away if was not for the hopes I have in the future. When you are lonesome and thinking of home you can always remember that I think of you every day and want you to come home as bad as you want to come.
My work for the month has to be done up now. Yesterday was Election day and the boys wanted the return by wire and I agreed to get them from 35 states for six dollars. So I have not had time to do anything today only copy bulletins of the election. Oh yes I will be pleased when I get the hat works. I must close now but will write you a letter tonight and give you all the news. Then you will receive it the next day after you get this. Give Anna my regards. I remain yours.
Truly,
EHC</p>

Dear Brother,
Yours of the 26 is received. Was glad to hear from you and hear you and all was well. I was sorry to hear of the Death of Mactard Bell Allen but we have all got to Dye some time. That we may be fine forever here after. I truly hope you will have a good time when you get married. I hope you will not have any brake up before the day comes. Well I have some news to write of any importance.
Today is Sunday I just got back from hunting. I got 2 turkeys. Will have a good dinner tomorrow. There is 30 miles of the R.R. done. 40 more will come to precut. Not much mining going on at present. Everybody in good spirit. I think we will have a break in the spring. Will close hopping to hear from you soon.
Goodbye,
J. Saul Chandler

Dear Nettie,
As I did not have time to write yesterday I will try and write to you today. I don't hardly know what I did write now I was bothered every few minutes. The boys are pretty lively but not very many drunk. Nettie I think you do awful well writing such nice long letters if you knew how I longed and waited for them you would not say it was no use for you to try to write as long letters I send you. Let them be long or short I find the most of my pleasure reading them. Even you was here now to tell me what you will same day. Yes Nettie I remember the night we was at the bridge and what we was talking about. I have thought about it lots of times and what I told you. I never told you all I intended to because you did not understand me right when I commenced tell you. I will tell you though the first time we have the pleasure of meeting would write it to you but don't think I could explain it so you could remember all that passed. I am referring to the night we was talking about Miss B. or rather making that our conversation. However I am well pleased the way every thing has turned out and hope I will never have any more such times. I think that will teach me a lesson. I would like to know what all Miss L. has told you. I think she is pretty good at telling anyway. Nettie there is nothing that I wont tell you now if you should ask. Or even try to keep anything secret from you in the future. I know now that you will be true to me. I knew the day we were over to the spring where we had the picnic that there was going to be a change but then I did not dream of it turning out like it has in first place. I knew Miss B. would be mad if she found it out and I was sure she would do that. I don't know that it makes it any lonesome for me since Stewart left or not he had not been in the habit of coming about me very much for some time. He never seemed like the same man to me after I joined the church. There has been several patrons went west since you left home but they were from out of the country so don't think you know them. I sold three tickets today to Florence, Kans. and one to Republican City, Neb. Did you know David Hollis of Nebo he dropped dead the other morning appearing well. Yes Maggie is lots of company. The night Bro Anthony stayed all night with me he asked where you was after we had retired. He had missed you he said several days ago I told him where you was he said he thought you was an awful nice lady and said he thought Maggie was a perfect angel. How does Billy like his place now? What does Mr. Kidd fallow I bet Bess feels big sure enough with his new suit. Last Sunday Eve I and Tan Calvin took a walk. He said he heard I was going to get married. Yes I told him I was same time this week. He asked who to, Nettie, Emma, or Hattie. I told him I didn't know yet, then he wanted to know if I had heard from you since you left. I told him yet I heard your folks talking about you. He sure changed the subject when he seen he could not gain anything. I thought he as most to suggestive and didn't give him any satisfaction.
I wouldn't think that Forger Hall's could agree very well, some of them members of the Church and some Saloon keepers would you. Yes suppose L. will style up now in great shape while her Pa has a good job and then she is going to get the richest man in this country. They can fix the parlor up in good shape now. Mousenbach is putting an addition to his store and has raised the old one up. Your Pa has built a new barn but suppose they have told you poor Gus has had a hard time too. Lizzie asked him the other day what he was digging that hale for why he said to put a stake in it. He meant a post. Give Anna my regards and thanks for her kindness. They are going to make a change in the church house. I understand they are going to keep the pulpit at the other end and turn the seats around. Well I have written all I can think of. I expect you will think that I write quite often. Well I thought I waited so long for an answer the other time so I wrote yesterday after now. Must get it off on the evening train then I thought I would hear from you one day soon. I wish you would have them put a mail train on for Sunday just for my benefit.
Yours Truly,
E.H. Chandler</p>

Dear Nettie,
Your kind letter received just now and I will try and answer so can send it off on the eve train. It seems like its been a month since I heard from you. I looked for a letter Monday and Tuesday. If I had not got one today I intended to write any way. You may know that i was awful glad to hear from you. Thats all I have been thinking about for the last three days. I don't know what kind of an out I will make writing today. I am bothered so often I forget what I was going to say. This is payday and it's raining and everybody is at home or at the depot asking same fool questions. There is nothing going on in Pearl of any account/ There is going to be a big meeting start here and all at Old Pearl Sat week. The Methodist members are here. A man got hurt in the quarry yesterday. I don't know his name. Got his head out. No, Miss B. has not come down yet. I don't think she will come. Yes Nettie the time you mention will suit me at present at least. We can fix it all right same time in the future.  But I have some time. But am satisfied when I know the time will come. If you was at home the time would not seem so long.
If you could remember you would know the man that Anna Lakin moved. He sold trees for a living and boarded at Lakin's and stayed at the saloons most of his time. I saw the hat you sent Maggie. I think it was just as well as could be. Nettie I am gal you do believe me and I am sure I believe all you say. If I did not I would not be paying all my attention to you. More than that, I think it would be doing any one a great injustice if they didn't mean all they say, especially on as an important a subject as we have been talking about.
Well it's impossible for me to write any more today but I will write to you again tomorrow night. Would have til tonight to have written to you but want to go to church,
Please excuse haste this time. Hoping to hear from you soon.
I remain yours truly,
E.H. Chandler</p>

<p>Sidney, Ia Oct 18th 1886
Mr. E.H. Chandler
my Dearest Friend,
Your most welcome letter received 16th (Sat.) and contents perused with great pleasure and now I will make an attempt to scribble a few lines in ans. I would have written yesterday (Sun.) only Will and Erin Kidd was here and spent the greater portion of he day. Anyway, I could not have sent it out from here until today had I written yesterday. I know it is of no use for me to try to write you the good long letter you wrote me. That I will do the best I can. I always long for your letters to come for you tell me more news about home than the home letters I get. Maggie is real good to write long letters. I got one from her the same day I got yours. It was such a large one she had to pay extra postage on it. She wrote me 1 and 1/2 sheet of Fools cap paper and another little piece besides and then with your goo long letter, I got plenty of news that day. On the day before I received yours I received two letters. One from Pa and the other from Johnnie. I think you all are awful good to write to me and I do love to get letters from home. I am writing on the paper you sent me. This is the first I have used of it.
I think it is too bad that you have to work so long over your time and have to miss church too. But one good thing is-it is not very often they keep you that way. I suppose it did seem rather lonely without Maggie or I either. But now Maggie has returned and I guess keeps you all plenty of company telling all she seen and heard while at the fair. Well she is better off than I for she has been to St. Louis now twice and I have never been there. I expect she had a grand time from what she said in her letter to me.
Well I suppose Army Lakin is well satisfied now that she is married again. I do not know her husband at all. What kind of a man is he- He must have some money or they could not afford to board.
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Well Pearl is losing some of her citizens. Bill Stewart and Whit Brown. Well I must say I don't think Whit will be much of a loss. Do you think so? I suppose you will find it rather lonely without Stewart as you two are together very much. So Mrs. Lannery and sister are visiting in Pearl.
</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">I am acquainted with Mrs. Lannery but not her sister. I have never seen her. Is Mr. Lannery and children there also?
</span>Oh yes - you had good reason for thinking of the last Saturday evening I spent in Pearl when with Billie Miller. Well I often think of our slopping place on the R.R. too. One time especially I think of very often. That time when Miss Boulton was our main subject and when I wished that I had stayed in Sidney so often also the night that I thought some one was under the bridge. Do you remember? Lige I do believe you. Don't say you think I do but make up your mind to say- you know I do. I do not know what month would be best at present but think it could be either the month of May or June which ever one would be preferable. Of course we may change our minds as to the time but now I think perhaps it could be there. I must say that I think Mr. Hess and Miss Frazier make themselves very busy about Miss Bartton. But Lizzie always did talk for Miss Button. I will tell you lots of things some day that she told me. I do not know how it is. Has Hattie come to Pearl yet. I suppose she surely is coming or at least mentioned it or Lizzie would not have been to the train. Oh my! Jed Frazier is at his old trade again. Well now I suppose he will gain in flesh again as he worked so hard over the river he was not one bit well or at least that is what Mr. Frazier said. It will be as Johnnie says I guess. Lizzie will begin to dress again. She always could dress better if Mr. Frazier  was staying in some saloon than any other time.
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Well I will close for this time hoping to hear from you soon.
</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Annie sends her kindest regards to you.
</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Oh yes! You ought to see Boss his Papa brought him a new suit of clothes from Reol Oak Saturday eve. He looks awful cute with them on. He looks much larger with them on than he does with dresses. And he feels and says he is just like Papa. This time I will close.</span></p>
<p>I am yours lovingly

Dearest Nettie,
Your kind letter of 10th received today and acutely read with the greatest of pleasure. I will now try and answer after a long days work. I commenced work this morning at 6:30 and quit tonight at 7:15 but a man that is unfortunate enough to have to railroad for a living must expect to put up with anything at any time. I was going to go to church tonight but did not get away from the depot till after the second bell had rung. I was landing to go to church then write to you after I came home. well they may keep me from going to church once in a while but they don't near fix me so I can't write you. The man Allen that went in to the church while you was at home has preached for us twice but I don't like him. Very well, I don't think he is sincere in what he preaches. I think he is too easily changed but hope he does mean all right anyway. Yes Nettie It's true there will be a time we all must part but I dully believe that its for a happier meeting. If we live as we should live while in this world. I know I am going to do the best I know how to get there and I think that will clear me. I trust you will remain firm to the end and I believe you will. Yes Maggie came home yesterday. She had a lot to tell about what she seen in St. Louis. She says she is writing to you today so I suppose she will tell you all about her trip. I was real glad she came home. It was awful lonesome without you or Maggie either at home. Ama Lakin married the man Wyrock. They are in Roadhouse boarding at the Phoenix house. The old folks wont let them come home. Ama run off and went to him.
No they have not commenced work on the new road yet and I hope they will not soon. There is no one here they knows what they will do yet. No Scruby did not come over Sunday. I saw old Opr. from Juseyville today. He said S. was coming out next Sunday. If he does I will give him your regards. Bill Stewart's folks are going to move to Nebraska. They ordered a car today. Bill is out there not. I think he is going to fix Quit Brown up out there with a law office. Emma Lamerny and Bell St. Armand came to Pearl today. Do you know they? They are Bill Hess's sisters.
I will tell you why I thought of the night I told you my wish when I was with Billy Miller. First was because it was the first time I had passed there since you left. That made me think of that time then I thought how glad I was that I didn't let the opportunity pass without asking you to be my wife and again I wondered how it was that Ammon would be deprived of all that was so dear to him. Why could I not as well have been with you that night as anyone else. I think any one should enjoy this life the best they can because we only live it once. No I will never forget that night and many other times that I was with you that I will not forget soon. I always think of our stopping place when I go down the railroad over the little bridge. Nettie I went with you down there once with the full intention of asking you to be my wife but when I thought I would wait till some other time. I didn't think about you leaving then. I loved you well enough long ago to ask you but for some cause I did not. I know it was not because I was afraid to. Yet I some times doubted getting a favorable answer but I fixed my mind to ask you, let the answer be yes or no. Now I think you will believe me and believe that my life for you will never change. And I am willing to trust you some of these days when I think you have about get your visit out I am going to name the matter to your Pa and Ma and see what they say about it. I know it will be a pretty tough question for me but I know I can. You remember we was talking about the time and that we would or could fix the day while you was out there. I will say that I am not wanting to rush about it but would like to hear about when you think it could suit you. Could you say in what month you will be mine forever? Now Nettie I would not write like this only I think that if you are as sincere about it as I am that it ives me the privilege. When you answer let me know what you think about it. It might be some help to me. When I know what times gets to be.
Lau Hess did not have much today to me. He said Hattie did not know that to think. He asked me what he should tell her. I told him I did not have any word to send.She knew that I would not answer the last letter she wrote me. Lizzie F. was over at the depot Saturday and said she was looking for Hattie at the noon train but I know she was not. She thought it would give me some uneasiness but I could of told her it would not. Now I have written all I can think of tonight. Tabe Heother has gone to St. Louis to work for a tobacco house. He is going to shovel for them. Jared Fragler is running his saloon for him. Now we'll close. Hoping to hear form you soon. I remain as ever
Yours Truly,
E. H. Chandler

My dear Friend,
I received your welcome letter yesterday and was very much surprised to hear that you were in Sidney and very glad too, but sorry to think I was not at home so you could visit me. I supposed you will be there when I come home Christmas and then we will have a splendid time. I returned to the Convent last Monday and I had written to you but sent it to Pearl, Illinois.
Brother John saw your brother before he left.
I am taking English, Fancy work, Music, and Singing. I was up to River on a week ago Saturday and bid the young people "Goodbye" and they were all very much surprised to hear that I was going away to stay till Christmas. I was very sorry to leave. Don't you think so?
When you see any of our set from Riverton please give them my kindest regards.
Please call on my sister-in-law Mrs. Joe Samuels while you are in Sidney. I know she will be glad to meet you.
Please give my regards to Mrs. Roush and children. I will close.
Love to you.
From Your True Friend,
Linnie Samuels</p>

Dearest Nettie,
Your kind and welcome letter received today. You don't know how glad I was to hear from you nor can I tell you however it found all wall. Nettie I haven't the least objection to you keeping company with Mr. Hill. I want you to see all the pleasure you can. I am perfectly satisfied when I have the assurance that you will remain true to your promise. I do not expect to keep company with any one while you are away altho I could keep other company for ever and know that my love for you could not be changed. My affections are to prematurely fixed ever to be changed. Your absence is making me a many a lonesome hour. I hope you will make up your mind to come home soon. I go out on the porch same times of evenings but don't stay long. I can't keep from thinking about you. I have opened my trunk every night to look at the picture of one that I have learned to love. I received your telegram OK at 9:45 pm. Same date but I had gone to bed. I came to the office at 8:30 to see if any had came. I was glad to hear your answer. OK I listened at My 13 Instrument all  day expecting to hear some one call me. The first thing I done in the morning was to call Bloomington and Kansas City up and ask them if they had anything for me. I was expecting to go to Louisiana or White Hall today but it is raining so hard I will have to give up the notion. If possible I will go one day next week. If I do I am going to get you the ring I promised you. Then I will ask you to wear it in remembrance of the promise. I will go to church tonight. The protracted meeting closed on Tuesday night. There was 71 joined all together, nothing new in Pearl. Your mother went visiting yesterday up to Mr. Betts. Maggie told me yesterday she got a letter from you also as to your regards to my self - many thanks. I am all alone today. Jae has gone up to see his sister. I wrote the Opr a letter at Sidney and told him to destroy the message. Then we wont have to make any report to the company about it will save paying the charges. I saw Lizzie Frogen the other eve. She said Lau want to see Miss Button every evening. Bro Anthony stayed all night at our house Tuesday night. Went off on morning train. I got a letter from Soruby yesterday. He is working at railroad for a few days. Bill Stewart is going to leave Pearl this week. I am going to have a lot of passengers from Pittsfield Monday morning for St. Louis exposition that will be a feather in my cap for them to leave the Wabash Road and come to Pearl. Well I must close lest I should make you tired. Hope this will reach you safely and find you well. Regards to all and love to all.
Yours Truly,
E.H. Chandler
