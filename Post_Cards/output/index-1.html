Miss Nettie Knox,
Dear Sister,
I will now try and answer your kind letter which I received 22nd and was glad to hear of you all being well as is expected of us at present.
Well Nett we are looking for Izora's folks down today to spend Christmas and O how we wish you and Anna was here too.
We have just killed two big turkeys. We have no help yet. Lizzie went home last Monday still grunting, and Ma and I have all this work. We thought that was another new dress you had got, we thought you was going to put on a happy dog. Have you got your black dress and that beautiful red made in Bella. Betts is not coming down till spring and I guess she will have company with her when she comes.
O yes about Mob Rose and Lansdon. Sadie Lewton found a letter that Mob had written to him but she wont tell what is in it. She has the letter - saving it so if any thing comes out she will have it to show.  Lizzie J says for you to write to her. Lizzie J made my dress. It is awful nice she just got it finished it is trimmed in velvet.
Mrs. Mearre is down sick with the lung fever. I guess Billie Shay is waiting on her.
O I am just crazy for you to come home. I want to see them sweet children so bad. Nett there is going to be a ball here tomorrow night in the Ha.. Both operations are boarding hereon. The night operation left Stathernsr and came here. He is awful cute. He isn't near as large as Sabrine. Lee says he is going to try to dance his first set tomorrow night.
Nett, Lon Woods gets married tonight to Belle Garrison and Mort Edwards was married Milton to a cousin of Lidia Kisey's. O yes tell Will that Mort Edwards was down yesterday and said he got a letter from Sabina the day before and she sent her regards to all the folks especially Willie. She is in Ohio.
Belle Berry is coming back the first of next month.
Well I wish I had some of those pretty toys out there because I don't expect any here. O it is the driest Christmas I ever say except the Saloons.
Tell the children I am as ugly as a muck fence.
Well Nett, Ma will send you $5.00 for yourself and $5.00 for the children to get them some presents. I guess that is all she can send this Christmas.
Well I haven't time to write any more. We are so busy now. With love to all and a portion for myself. I remain your loving sister,
Maggie Knox
Christmas gift to all.
Nett, Ligo is sick for two days but I guess it is grieving over you.
M.K.</p>

Miss Nettie Knox,
My dear sister I will now try to drop you a few lines in a  hurry as it is almost train time and I have been so busy I did not take the time to write any sooner. I was glad to get so long a letter from you and to hear of you all being well as it leaves us all at present. Well Nettie I am so delighted Jasper Walk just came off the noon train today and said that he had rode on the train from Alvin to White Hall with Willie and that he had gone to St. Louis to work in a  big drug store. I can't hardly believe it as I got a letter from Johnnie yesterday and he never spoke a word about it but then I suppose it is time I hope so any how for he will be so close to us.
Perhaps he can be home with us Christmas. O I only wish you all would be here. We are going to have a nice time tomorrow night. We are going to have a tree in the church . We expect a fine time, Papa wrote John &amp; Will letters yesterday and sent you $2.00 and John $5.00. That is awful little bit is the best they could do. Momma intended to send you both some money but she never got but $3.00 of Lige's money this month. So of course she could not send any. Ella and Mr. Bills came home yesterday. They have an awful sweet little baby. Ella isn't as big as a thimble. She is the She is the least little bit of a scrap you ever saw. I guess she will send you one of the baby's pictures. She gave me one. O yes and so did Lige give me one of his pictures. I guess you know he had some taken in St. Louis. He received them yesterday I think they are awful nice. I think they would have been better if he had kept his hat off. He is getting awful good . He lets me see most every letter he gets from you and you can bet that strikes me. Well, Izora and I went to Milton yesterday. We left home at 1 am and got back at 6, so you can see we made a day trip. She got Vinnie a lovely cloak or rather the making of it. She could not get a ready made cloak in Milton for Vinnie. The cloth is beautiful. It was $2.00 per yard. Also got herself a cloak for $5.00 and got Myrtle and May two big China dolls. I have got the dressing of them to do today so as to be ready for the tree tomorrow tonight. Mamma got each of the girls a cap the same as I sent Liney and that is all she could get for them. I am so sorry in one way that Willie has gone to St. Louis as he will be so far away from John but then I'll bet John will get along. I do hope he will get a school or some employment in a store for I don't like for him to have to go on a farm but then he would not have to stick to that always. John was telling me in his letter about John and Lucy acting the free Methodist. I would like to see them. I'll bet it is equal to a circus. Well Nettie, Papa is writing a few more lines to John and he is waiting on me to get through so I will close. I know you can't read this for I have written t in such a hurry. Don't wait so long as I have done. I will also try to do better in the future. Wishing you all a merry Christmas and a happy new years.
I am your loving sister.
Maggie
Love to all.</p>

Miss Nettie Knox,
Dear sister and all the rest. I will attempt to answer your kind and welcome letter which I received yesterday and of course was glad to hear of you all being well as this leaves us at present with the exception of Lizzie. She seems to be getting along very slowly.
Well Nett, we got a letter from Willie yesterday and he is giving me thunder for not writing to him. He calls me Gemmie all through the piece. He said he was going to give Gemmie (that is me) thunder when he saw her.
Nett the bridge boys are gone. They went to Chicago last Friday morning on the early train but we had the best dance of the season on Thursday night before they left. The dance was for them. Well this is Monday and no one has even heard from Ella or Betts. They have never written a sentence home. Moreover, no one ever hears of them. I think it is terrible the way they are acting. Aunt Sarah is taking it quite hard. Everyone thinks them tails are so on Ella from the way she has acted. God knows where they are. Lizzie T. has left us. She got sick and could not work anymore. So, Ma and I do all the work.
Nett there was no one event in or from church with Lizzie T. She never went very many nights there is in church. More hasn't been for a week. I haven't went in school for five weeks nor I don't guess will go much more but you know that just kills me. There is quite a stink going around about Lausdon and Moll Rose getting in thick. I guess they will have was here if the directions of the school and Mrs Lausdon hears is I guess they both will be expelled from teaching school it it gets out. Nett don't dance yourself to death at that party at Riverton Friday night. We danced here till 3 o'clock and I danced every set but 2. May says if Anna thinks best for you to get a chart for you. She gets one and learns everything about dress making you can.
We have the stove we had last winter upstairs and Pa got a great large box stove for the from room downstairs. It takes in a whole wood stick without cutting it in two.
Nett you must not get in such contacts with yours anymore or it will go off the next time sure. I read the letter with John and all the folks when I got it and of course read it about yours more before I thought so. I guess he has given it to you hot and heavy about it.
Well Nett Dock Meauk has him at $40.00 suit. Both he and Mace Smith got a suit just alike and they are lovely.
Dock came down to spend Thanksgiving with Matt and he was drunk every day while down. He stayed till Sunday.
We had a big sleet last night and a little snow. It is awful slippery this morning and cold as Greenland. Nett you must be sure and make Mr. Roush and Annie come home with you. Don't you come till they are both ready to come with you.
Well Anna Coales is over to Trazrero today having her a dress made. It is grey goods. Anna won't look in here since yesterday morning. She told the biggest lie that ever was told. She was down last Sunday and she told me that Mrs. Greathouse was down to their house the other day and she (Mrs. Greathouse) said that the same tails on Ella was out on Lizzie Johnston all over Minton that everybody was talking about it and so Lizzie and I went and seen mrs. Greathouse and asked her if ever she heard such a and thing and she said she never did in her life and said if Anna did tell that it was some of her own little lies. Lizzie is going to jump onto Anna abut it if ever she gets a chance but Anna goes by here running as hard as she can, she know she has told a lie. So you see when your not here they are going to pick on Lizzie. Well I guess this is all at present. I remain your sister.
R.
Write soon.</p>

<p>Sunday eve. Dec 6 1885
Miss Nettie Knox,
Dear Sisiter Nett,
It is with great pleasure I answer your welcome letter which came to hand yesterday. Was very glad to hear from you and to hear of your arrival safe and sound. Well Nett is a great pleasure to you to be with Anna and folks. Nett I was down home last Sunday. Lizzie was not well but she breached up in the eve. That fellow from Greene was coming over. His name is Alverson. I didn't see him. We left before he came. Nett when I was down home there was a fellow come in the house to Ma with tears in his eyes. Ma says what is the matter Lige. He says Mrs. Knox when is Nettie coming home. He said he didnt know whether he could stand it any longer or no. I felt sorry for the poor fellow and he joined the church too. Oh he is going to be a good boy and do so much. Nett it seems like you have been gone six months. It seemed so lonesome when I was home, Nett it made me feel so bad because I did not see you before you left. I had no idea of you going so soon. I went to Roadhouse with Smith white at Pearl. Maggie sent by me and got her a blue like your brown dress. Its a beauty. Maggie and Lizzie has got pretty hats. Smith went over to Milton the other evening and got ma a handsome white hood. Oh its a daisy. Nett they are having fly times on the bottom now. I seen Maggie Hawk and Roth. They were very anxious that you would come over and spend the most of winter over here so you would all have a good time. Lucy is still at Crabtree's. She was here the day after I got the letter from you. She said she was going to write to you. Nett they had a big meeting over the river, recently had a big time everybody fined. Harve's will have to quit having dances. There isn't enough girls left to dance on that side of the river. Clem, Alt, and Belle all fined and I know not how many others. Mrs. Trulmes fined too. I think if it had continued a while lounger Harle and Carry would have gone up. Milam and wife went up, it was the sanctified Methodist. McLaughlin and six of course you know them they got 30 additions to the church while here, oh yes they are going to build a new church right off.

Dear Brother,
I will write you a few lines past to let you no that I am well and hope this will fin you the same. I haven't any news to write. Times is dull hear at present. The weather is cold and damp. I have been working in the Creek for the last 2 weeks. Done well part of the time. Our rail road has not been built yet. Don't think it will be completed this winter. Our working men are all back in Colorado at present. I don't know whether they will com back this winter or not. I hope not as the winter time is not a good time to look at armies. I had a letter from one of them the last mail. He said if they come it would be soon so I don't no whether they will come or not. There haven't been no girls hear but in town there are some. You bet one to cook that would be way up here. I guess not but my lady neighbor that J. spoke of once before and I have had a spell.
Well as there is no news I will quit. Write soon and after tell john and Sasha I would like to see them.
Goodbye

My Dear Friend,
I received your welcome letter some days ago and I have been over to Sidney the past few days and so I have not had any time to write since I came home.
No. - Mr. Talbot does not intent to return.
Mr. Ellis left last Tuesday, a week from today, I just came up from Hamburg as he got on.
He said to give you and your brother his kindest regards the next time I wrote.
Mrs. Jackson did not give his party as she expected for she had no help.
She was very sorry I saw he Sunday and she and Uncle sends their regards and all the Riverton boys and girls you are acquainted with. I suppose you were out to the "Poor Farm" when you were here! I was there last Saturday
My brother John that lived with us has moved to Riverton, he moved yesterday.
I saw Miss Ellie Cromwell last Thursday and gave her your regards and she sends many in return.
I am going up to Riverton this afternoon so I must close. Please give my regards to all.
From Your Friend,
Linnie Samuels</p>

<p>Dear Friend,
I received your unexpected, welcome epistle this last week and I was so glad to hear from you. I had begun to think you had forgotten me entirely as I never received yours before the 4th of July. I have been going to school ever since Sept. and have no done much visiting not went any thing. We have a dandy Professor this term. His name is Hand. They have placed those looks back and made two rooms up stairs. Mr. Farris has one room. Do you go to school if not come up and see me or if you do come Friday with the mail Saturday if you can not miss school and H.G. and I will take you back Sunday. How does that strike you by this; you see H.G. and I still cling together. Dick Mc told you a he 'cause Stan and Link has not busted. Frank Foreman of Detroit goes with Lill Watts. Bert Hanks of Detroit goes with Ada. Otis Smitherman went with Mary S for a while but they are broke now. Nina Lester went with Tom Morris but bused I believe now. Mary S never told me none of adventures while in Roadhouse but she told the other girls and she don't talk about anything now only that she has no more sense than when you hired her. I suppose you found that out did she stop at your house. I thought something of coming down after the 4th of July but never got an answer to my letter and supposed you didn't want me very bad. Nellie Davis will read here Wednesday eve. DOn't know whether I will go or not. Milton is awful dry nothing to go to only S.S. and church.
I heard a little while ago that Lori B was in Milton but she has not went down home, I guess she wont. She has been done since the 6th of Aug. she went up to Astoria where Rox lives and stayed three (3) weeks and came back to Pittsfield and has been working in the hotel as a dining room girl. Poor fool do all of that for the sake of a brainless lad. Well I guess I will close for this rainy Sunday morn hoping to hear from you soon if not sooner.
Good bye
Yours,
Kate G.</p>

Dear Friend,
I received your most welcome letter some time ago. Hope you will excuse my long delay about answering and I will be more punctual in the future. Ma has been in bed sick for over a week it seems as though she will never be well anymore. Will is down with typhoid malarial fever. He has been down over two weeks and is able to sit up in bed now. Since I received your letter I have been having a good time going to meeting there. Have been having meeting two weeks. The Babtise and Presbyterians both having meeting, at once and the churches are not more than two hundred yards apart. They shouted so loud I believe they could have been heard a mile. The first night I was scared half to death for fear that they would get to beating one in the back. I have so much work now that I can scarcely get time to write any more. We are putting up hay and I am going to singing and taking music lessons and it keeps me stirring to get my work all done. I have just finished one letter before yours, and I have two more to write this evening. Tell Ella that I will be sure and write to her before long. Do you ever see Carrie Loandess. I have not heard from her in a long time. So many that have seen your picture have complimented it highly. Tell Ella that I would be pleased to get any kind of a picture of her. Sam sent his best wishes to you and the family and says he would love to see you all. He said that he sent your Pa some papers and want to know if he ever received them. The have brought my horse up and are wanting me to go to the peach orchard for some peaches so I will close with much love to yourself and family. Write soon.
Your True Friend,
Katie Cumoy</p>

Dear Friend,
I thought I would write you a few lines for I have not forgotten you but I expect that you have forgot me ere this. I have waited for you to write for so long, we are all well as common except Pa he is suffering with the tenalgia. Do you have much enjoyment? Now a days I have a very good time considering I live in the country. We live three miles from Mesquite but I have a good riding horse and I get on him of a Sunday and it does not take me long to go to church and Sunday school. There are a great many young folks here and I like them all so well, we have a splendid Sunday school. The average attendance is 100. We are going to have a picnic on the 28th of this month I anticipate on having a splendid time. We have an organ in the church. Manda preforms for them, Eustace and Manda live in Mesquite now. Eustace has a lumber yard there. There is a singing teacher coming out from Dallas to teach a class. There are 42 in the class. I am going to attend. His wife teaches music I expect to take music lessons also. I wish you were here to go with me. Give my love to Ella and tell her to write to me. Please tell me her post office address so I can write to her whether she will write me or not. Give my love to Maggie, tell her I would love to see her, I often think of our good old school days and the romps we used to have to get her. Would love to call them back for awhile were it possible. Please excuse my poorly written letter for I am writing at night while siting up with Pa. With love to the family and a better portion to yourself. I remain a true friend.
