<p>Dearest Honey:---
I sure am curious to know why you asked me if I'd love you even though you didn't love me and decided not to marry me. I'm not going to let you decided not to marry me, or at least I'm going to do my damnedest not to. The true answer though, is that I'd still love you. --- But why did you ask me that. Hope it wont turn out that way. I'd sure feel awfully badly about it if it did.
We had a very successful meal at home last night. Mart &amp; I decided to go home and cook a meal in preference to going to the movie show. We had sirloin steak, fried potatoes, macaroni and cheese, green onions, buns and butter, and coffee and pumpkin pie. Sure was a good meal. You should see me wash dishes. I'm getting to be an expert. I had the table all cleared up and washed the dishes in about ten minutes. Freddy wiped 'em. --- I'm practicing so's perhaps, mebbe, I'll wash the dishes for you one in awhile. That's a promise Honey.
The poker game was successful, in a way. I won $22, but loaned out $15 more that I won, so in a way I won, and another way I lost. However, I think its all good. I'll get it sometime. Gosh but I'm tired today, though. That's what I don't like about it. Always feel so tired the next day. Its lots of fun though. The boys crack funny jokes, and we manage to have a pretty good time out of it. Also I'll be able to sleep good tonight.
Guess Mart &amp; I will go McVickers tonight. And get home early and get a good night's sleep. I've got to work tomorrow afternoon. Haven't seen a movie show all week. Ye Gods how I wish you were here to go with me. Honey, again I tell you I miss you like hell.
Did you get the new Motion Picture magazine. Haven't seen the latest issue of the Photoplay, but I'll send it when it comes out. Can you think of any books you'd like to have, or anything else, just let me know, and I'll be tickled to death to get 'em or it for you.
Sure was foggy this owning. The levanted trains went along like snails this morning. All three of us came down to work together and thought sure we'd be late. But we started about fifteen minutes earlier than usual this morning , we wanted to get a heavy breakfast. And the L's were so slow we didn't even have tim e to get a cup of coffee. Just barely managed to get in the office at one minute after nine. It was so foggy you couldn't see ten feet away. Just like old Lunnon.
Guess I'll drop this in the mail box now so's perhaps you'll get it Sunday, if the post office is open.
Wish I was going to see you this evening. Hope you come back soon.
I love you, Honey.
Russ,</p>

Dearest Everyone,
Though I'd better write few lines right away as I just had a letter from Bess and Knox saying mama intended to visit me and I wanted to tell her that I've moved again. They transferred me to ward 11, annex 2 Wednesday evening. I didn't even get an examination at general hospital. Guess Mama is there now. Sure will be glad if she can come up. Hope some of you can come up. Hope some of you can come with her. I don't know what they're figuring on doing with me. I feel fine and dandy. I'm afraid my compensation claim will get a set back if the diagnosis made here stands. 'Course I wont care if the diagnosis is correct. Naturally, I'd rather be free from TB than have the pay.
We had good dinner yesterday. I'll enclose the menu. I'm the afternoon a lot of us went to football game, Marquette vs. Ames, Marquette winning 6 to 0. We had passes. I had a notion to ask for pass to come down there for Thanksgiving but when they transferred me Wednesday evening, I didn't have a chance, as the doctor on this ward was gone Thanksgiving day.
I like this ward better than any I've been in so far. Only two beds in each room and the rooms are nice. We ear at Annex 1, only a block away. Eat in general dining room.
Mama when you come up, take the north shore line. Get off at 1st Ave and National Ave. Thats a regular hop on the North Shore line. Then you catch a National Ave. car, which would bring you right up in front of our place. Or else if you'll let me know what time you'll be here, and how you're coming, I'll meet you down town. I don't expect to be here very long. I don't think there's anything wrong with my thyroid gland, and if I haven't got I want to get out.
The American Legion, Wisconsin Department, sent each man here a check for $1 yesterday. There's about 500 here. I squandered mine on a show after the football game.
Russ, I stopped in at journal yesterday. Scott was only man on duty. He said HJD got beat up and was in hospital. That so? He hadn't heard that WS got slugged. He showed me a letter he had written to PDP asking for a raise. Grammatically, it was a farce.
Well, I'm out of paper so will sign off.
Mama, you be sure to let me know when you are coming.
Love to all,
Mart.
Ward 11 Annex 2</p>

I arrived before the flood and got to take in all that was left. It sure was awful. No one can imagine how bad it was. But my friends live up high. Will let Ruby know when to expect me.

Dear Sister and Family,
It may be of interest to let you know of the death last night of Mrs. Ethal Whitesideler. We had Doctor Nosbry of Springfield to see her early of week. Her home is a paradise, they have everything of the very best in the home that anyone could wish for. Simply wonderful to see some of the rooms, how magnificently they are furnished. Russell said he saw Loren and Grace for a few moments, they had stopped at a garage to get some air. Russell's one of a class of 28 to graduate from N.H.H.S. Commencement tonight at Frenless Theatre, there are 5 numbers in the program by members of the class. He will appear in two of them, in voice, solo, and in a quartette (boys). We expect Lucille and Braus Ford this afternoon. They were much in evidence at the H.S. Commencement. Lucille was to sing, he to make the address. We will expect Grace and Loren to stop in their return.
Your Bro,
W.T.K.</p>

My Dear Sir:
Your communication with reference to your daughter, Annie Chandler, received and in reply beg to state we do not think it advisable for her to leave the institution at this time, however if you desire to have her paroled defiantly in order that she may be taken out of the institution and provided for, we will be glad to have you write us to that affect.
By taking the patient home for a few days only, we do not think the reaction is for the benefit of the patient and we will have to respectfully decline your request.
Very truly yours,
E. L. Hill
Managing Officer</p>

Dear Sister and family,
I have since you were here, been making inquiry whenever I could in regard to the "Annex" to the State Hospital. These buildings are for Vocational training of patients that can be trusted or handled outside of the main building. This state and Hospital has gained world wide reputation since taking up this line of training of inmates and has recently attracted leading physicians of other state institutions there to learn the details of this work. The idea is this: to give those that can be trusted the best of environments afforded with something to keep their minds and body employed and with the training and treatment, many of them will soon recover. Dr. Chapin was here yesterday. He speaks very highly of Dr. Hill, and of being a gentleman of the highest type, but his letter to you was a mistaken identity - or he was badly off. I want to go to the Hospital and meet Dr. Hill and would like D. C. or some other physician of acquaintance to go with me.
I believe the Annex is the best for Annie, she has heard of the Annex, and formed a wrong conception of its purposes. Perhaps though after patients that did not know any more of it than she didd and had become biased against it by name, without knowing its real purpose. Mr. and Mrs. Fox, Edith &amp; Mildred drove to Pittsfield Friday, stopped at Milton for minutes. Mr. Fox has business that took him there.
Lucile is home, expect to remain for another week or possibly longer. I am expecting to go to J-Ville soon and will if I have the time to visit the Hospt, but doubt  that invite. I expect to take a patient to Dr. Morbury and other doctors for examination and may be crowded for time at the visit. What has become of John? I used to hear from him once and a while, not for a long time now.
Your Bro,
W.T. Knox</p>
