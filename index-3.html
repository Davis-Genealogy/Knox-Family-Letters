Miss Nettie Knox,
Dear old Gal, it is now I will try to answer your welcome letter which I received some days ago. Was truly glad to hear from you as I did not look for a letter so soon. Maggie started for St. Louis this eve I think she will have a nice time. She and Mrs. Crohm has gone together. She is going to stay a week. Oh wont she have a flip time. She made her brown dress. It fits splendid. She also made her calico she had splendid luck in making her dresses. Oh she looked so nice, she wore my hat.
Oh yes that Hill don't forget the way to come. I think he must be interested. Some may hurrah for Hill and Chandler. Poor Lidge, he nearly dies. He gets so lonesome, he said the other day that he had got a letter from you. I ask him when you were coming home, he said he did not know when but he wished that he did know.
Oh yes they had a dance here Wednesday night. Rothia Young and Maggie Hawk were ones they reported splendid time. But I tell you they can't get us two girls in to dancing.
Uncle Dave and Uncle Jim went to Pittsfied. They went to the Democratic Rally, they report a large crowd.
Annie Coates hasn't been here for some time. She is mad Chrley Hess went with her one night - from church and since that night - he has got terrible friendly with Lizzie F.
Sunday Morning: Will finish, Oh you ought to see Lidge with his stiff hat on he looks Boss in it.
Lizzie is coming over to eat dinner. Well it's nearly mail time. Lidge has just gone from dinner. Has the children got the whooping cough. Write all the news. Lou, Hess came home Friday but will go back. Love to all,
Every your Cousin,
Lizzie</p>

My Dear Friend -
I will now attempt to answer your most esteemed letter which I received last Wednesday and was very glad to year form you. Mr. Talbot has gone to his home in Ky. and Mr. Ellis is going this week or next.
Mrs. Jackson is going yo give him a party before he goes and I intend to attend it, and you may bet we will have a jolly good time.
The Ladies of the W. F. M. S will give a basket social at the Methodist church this evening.  I do not think I will attend.
Does Mr. Knox think of coming back to this country any more?
If he does you must come with him.
I would like ever so much to have you come and make me a visit this fall if I do not go back to school. Miss Knox I consider you as one of my best friends and will for ever.
I rather think you met Miss Thompson when you were here. She goes with mr. Fred Wricks. He is called "Little Fred."
I am going over to Sidney next week and I am most sure I will see Miss Olive Crumble and I will give her your best regards.
I will bring my letter to a  close.
Much love to you and all
From your true friend,
Linnie Samuels</p>

Dear Nettie, Annie, and children
I received a short note from Nettie yesterday eve. Was glad to find by it that you were all well as this leaves us all at present. Altho the folks are somewhat disappointed. Nettie wrote a letter to Willie which were received same eve he left. Thot you folks were going to be here, but he had already gone before your letter got here. Still they expected you all the same as you never contradicted your statement to him. I came nigh down to White Hall on Wednesday eve. When you did not get here on the noon train thinking you would be like on the 12 o'clock at night but did not go but concluded to staying up here until the 12 o'clock train would come but still you did not. Just in appearance I hope all is for the best. I got a letter from Willie dated 29, that was the first I've had from you to know what you had done. He said you were undecided whether you would come till after the 4, but thought you would come with Quincy the same you went, and thought he probably would come see you right now and though he probably might come too, but today I received a letter from him from Dosmoine's, of date July 1st. He was sent there as a assistant to some delegate to the state convention. He says he has met several acquaintances . Speaks of a Dr. Clark who resides there formerly of Freemount. Speaks of a J. M. Hammond showing him great favour. He says yes and Annie will think he has forgotten you as he promised to look up the best route for you to come. I sent him a letter to Sidney yesterday thinking he was as likely to get it there as any where. As he told me that he and Hatten had played out. He told me that he would quit before he left he thought we or they are making large preparations here for tomorrow. It is said there will be a very large crowd here they are coming from Manchester Roadhouse, Whitehall Strout, Neb., and nigh all of Milton is expected . They are fixing up pretty nice for Pearl.
There is no use bothering you with a lengthy letter as I suppose you will soon all be here. Hoping to see you all soon. I am as every your Pa.
Love to all,
DKnox</p>
<p>If you see Willie tell him I will not write him til I hear from him again.
DK</p>

Dear Friend,
I once more scratch you a few lines in remembrance to you that I have not forgotten your smiling face yet nor do I think I will soon. But I guess you have thought nothing of poor Bub. You are seeing all the fun you can wish for I suppose. I have had no fun since I saw you last. I guess you are aware that I wrote to you last and not knowing as you was mad or not I thought I would like to find out. Hope you will not be offended by my writing to you with out your answer. I would like to see you the best kind. When do you think you will come home or do you think you will ever come back and see the people here. I guess you have made a grand mash out there and think nothing about the boys here. Hope you will get back by the fourth. Are you married or not - hope not. I am not but would like to be. I will close hoping to hear from you sooner. Best regards to Mr. Roush and family, nettie Knox, and all loving kindness to yourself
I beg pardon if not requested.
As ever your true friend

Dear Sisters, G.R., and Children
I arrived here yesterday morning at 4:10 from Kansas City. I had to go to Hainburg on Saturday morning and has to lay over in Hainburg until Sunday on account of there being no train. I failed to find everything as expected.
I should have left on Friday evening so as to have arrived here on Saturday. I went to Pittsfield yesterday morning to attend the convention. Pa had went the night before. There were a very large attendance at the Convention. It might be fore G.R.'s benefit give the nominees. Ed. Dorcy Ca Judge by acclimation, VA Gruos by acclimation. K. Midvilleton for sheriff in the 44th ballot. Mr. Coley for Treasurer I think on the 60th and C.J. Swan for Dept. I seen Riley Smith ten, he said all were well. I am surprised he followed yesterday morning by coming in and working them all up. Then he kept working while I found Maggie and Lizzie room.
I haven't got much time to write now before mail and will try and write more in my next. Hoping you will be ready to come soon.
Love to all,
Will</p>

Dear Nettie, Annie, and all the family,
I do not think I answered your last letter to me. Have been very busy for the last week. I took a great interest in the nomination of some of the candidates, for some of the various places to be felled this fall and all. I though aught to be nominated but there, of course you would not know their names if I was to tell you. You may bet I was some surprised when Willie walked up to me in the Courthouse yard yesterday and say's how do you before I even saw him or knew he was about. I left home on Sunday Eve to attend the convention to be at P. Mofela  next day. So Willie came in on Monday morning at 4:10, before any of our folks were up he went up stairs thinking w slept up there but when failed to find us, he then came down and went to get onto the lower part of the House but failed. Your ma and Maggie were sleeping together, so the men got up to examine who was at the door. Gus got up as it was his time to get up anyway and opened the door. Willie walked in, said nothing, went to the bedroom door where your Ma and Maggie was. Your Ma opened the door a little, but did not get a fair look and did not know him but Maggie peeked out still being in bed and squalled at the top of her voice oh it's Willie. Ma and Maggie had lots of excitement that day, and could not be convinced that you and Annie were somewhere secreted but, of course, composed themselves agreeably to have the pleasure of seeing Willie. He looked well and seems to have good health. You may believe he met with Warren Fosiment yesterday in Cittafield. I bet if he would have drank he could have a bit. He met all the Detroit and Florence, Feprounds, and Monteguma. I tell you they were all glad to see him. Willie said you folks were coming down in a week or two, all for the best. Of course you will be here before Willie returns.  He has been telling us lots of the news. How Luary can sing heel and toe and the boys coming in on the polka. Oh you may tell J. and the boys that this short legged boy is still training. He can jump full turn and pestle, but I think the boys will down him, because his leg is too short. Igora and Lolisa was here Saturday and went home Sunday. All Well Spemmily Smith is still working 3 miles on the Quarry at $2.25 in muscle a day. I think he is doing very well but has to stick steady and shortly to work no shuffling work must be done and attended to so far as the most work is concerned, as they have 125 men dependent on the work of the mules hauling the rock. For so far Smith is doing all right. Your Ma was poorly for 2 days last week took another bout out Cholera last week but is now all right.  We had another girl last week to help but she turned her off as soon as was ably to go into the kitchen again and that make it mostly hard on her in this very warm weather. I have no more with writing to mention . Maggie is now engaged to King her music teacher. Lefan is progressing very well. I am greatly hoping to find you all well. I will now quit.
From yours,
Joe D. Knox</p>

Miss Nettie Knox,
Dear old toy, I will now after so long alive try to answer your letter which I received some time back but you can bet I haven't forgotten you and don't think I will soon. I hope you still think of me sometimes. I would love to see you once more I think I could talk some if I saw you.
Well Nett, Maggie is the mash of Pearl. She can step out with any one of the kids she can get beat me I tell you.
Well Stuart is my fellow at present but don't think it will last long. Oh yes I have been going some with Joe Stathen. He is real cute, I know you would get mash on him. Nett I guess Hill is the solid man with you. If he suits you hang on to his coat collar.
Oh yes Mrs. Marx and Shay were married last week. She is alright now for she was stuck on Billey. She was married in a brown dress and looked very well but didn't have much style about them. Stybird said she was going to have a new papa but she did not want him. Lizze F just got back from Petersburg. She and Press and Mrs. Davis all went. She has been grunting ever since she came back. She looks like she was dead with the consumption. She looks horrible bad.
Well Ligey still goes with Emma Carter. Oh I don't like her not even a little bit. Well Nett when do you think of coming home. I wish you was here and out around with Ligey once more. Well I guess I will end as it is 11 o'clock. I must go to bed. Write soon. I know you have more time than I have. Answer soon as you get this. Give my love to Annie and all the fam. Write soon.
Lizzie J.
Be sure and write soon hun.
Tell Hill I said for him to let you come home till you can go back just for fun. Hill is hard to climb. Nett be careful don't clime to high. Nett I think you might tell me when you are going to get married.</p>

Dear Sister,
I will now attempt to answer your kids letter which I received on the 25th and was glad to learn of you all being well as it leaves us at present.
Well Nett I went to White Hall last Wednesday and came back Friday. Had an awful nice time while there. We attended the Strawberry and Ice Cream Festival Wednesday night and on Thursday, Luke Mc Junior and Frank Orten (my fellow) hired rigs and we went to Carrolton started about 10 o'clock in the morning and never got back till 5 in the evening so you can see for yourself how I enjoyed myself. White Hall is a beautiful little town. Lizzie Johnston and I went out to Green Pond yesterday to attend a declaration. I've had a real nice time, saw lots of folks. No I see you and Hill have not split yet. Nor is not likely to be. I don't think but if I was him I would get a little cranky if you run around with other fellows.
Well Nett Smith has gone up home this morning. He started before breakfast. He was pretty home sick. He had not been home for a week so you may know he wanted to see Ande and the children. Well Nett you must think lots of your silk dress from the way you talk. Well I believe. I would think as you great dear about me to think about.
Well Nett my tan lace has not come yet it is now 1 week since eI sent for it. I don't think they ever got my order for it. Well I need not be in any hurry about it any how for I am not going to make it till you and Annie comes home. I don't know whether that will be very soon or not. Hope it will.
Well Nett I got a letter from Will the same say I got yours and he said he did not think he could come home this summer. Oh I don;t want I'm to back out coming for I told you before how it was I am going to write to him this eve and insist on him coming. Will wrote me that a friend of his by the name of Kidd was visiting in White Hall. I made inquiries about him while I was there but I could find no one that knew him.
John and Jennie Martin still goes together. She is in Elesberry, Mo. now but they correspond all the time. I don't see what he thinks about to go with her. Stuart and Lizzie still goes together I think she is very foolish too to go with such a dog as Bill Stuart. She is keeping it all silent from her mother. Lou Hess goes with Lizzie Frazier yet.
Nett, Ma will send you $10.00 if you need any more just say. Well Nett I can't write very much this time, so I'll write no more now.
I am as ever your sister
Write soon,
Maggie
Love to all</p>

Miss Nettie Knox,
Dear Sister,
I will now attempt to answer your kids letter also picture which I received 19th I was glad to hear of you all being well as it leaves us at present.
Well Nett I think the last picture you sent us was more like you than any yet but Ma likes the head and shoulders the best. Nett what dress did you have on.
Well they had or tried to have a dance at Garrison Wednesday night 19th but they only danced two sets till it broke up in a row. There was nobody there but some old women that is no on by my account.
Izora's folks are coming down tomorrow (Sat). Smith is going to drive 3 trucks on the Quarry at $6.75 per day. He starts to work next Monday. He is getting good pay if he will only keep it but I fear that will be the trouble with Smith when he gets to Pearl.
Well next month is the month that Will is to come home and I do hope he will come for we want to see him so bad. I hope by that time that you and Annie will be ready to come with him. Oh how glad would I be if I could see you all step off the train together. We are glad to hear that you are enjoying yourself so nicely. Are you still going with Hill. You did not say much about him in your last letter. He will get mad if you go to "flirting" around with other fellows. I wanted heard from "Gray" since last week. He got hurt very badly by a falling timber last Tuesday and has been laid up in bed so he could not move but he was sitting up yesterday. Nettie don't for goodness sake let Hattie mention to Pa anything that was in that letter I sent to you about him. Nett I have got a beautiful tan colored cashmere dress. Have sent to St. Louis for 6 yards of tan oriental lace today. Will send you a piece of both in my next letter. I am not going to make it till you and Annie comes home. I made a blue worsted dress last week, cut and  made every stitch myself.
No we have not got any new furniture since you left. Aunt Anna;s folks has not moved yet either but I guess they will move the first of August.
nett does Will keep constant company with any one. If he does tell him to put her aside till he comes home and I don't want him to stay only 1 or 2 weeks either when he does come we would like so well for you all to come soon especially Will for we think it would change Pa to some extent for Nett remember done let Will mention any thing to Pa about it.
Annie Coates is well but Aunt Sarah is sick. She had a head chill last Monday night and has been sick ever since but she is getting better now.
Well Nett I guess I will go to While Hall next Wednesday if nothing happens between now and then. Alex Crawford goes with Kate Honan and John Honan still goes with Annie Coates.
Lizzie said to tell you no that O'Brien did not have on a white hat when she saw him so I guess he is not the one.
Nett I don't see how you can keep up with such stylish people it wouldn't do for me to go out there for I don't know how to put on so much style. Nett Ligey said if you did not come home pretty soon he would strike out after you. Well I will have to write a short letter as my music teacher is coming today and I will have to practice my lesson. So I will close this time. Hoping to hear from you soon.
I am your loving sister,
Maggie</p>

<p>From Creek, May the 12 1886
Dear Brother,
Yours of April the 27 is received. Was glad to hear from you and hear that all was well. I am not in very good health just at present. I have not been doing anything for two weeks. I have the rheumatism in my knee but it is getting better. Everybody has been under the weather. Hear this spring the weather has been so changeable is the cause I suppose.
Nothing new going on hear at present everything is dull. If the rail road comes it will help some but it is not certain yet whether it will come or not but people seem to think it is a sure thing. Well I wish I had been there to a went to church with you. It had been a long time since I was at church . Well you made a good run at the election. You did not say what you run for. Well as I haven't any news to write I will close. Give my regards to all John and Sasha especially yours truly. Write soon and often as you can.
Goodbye
J.Saul Chandler
E.H. Chandler
it is rainy tonight I hope the weather will change to better.</p>
