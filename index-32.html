Dearest Folks,
Arrived there last night and went to work this am. Been all day checking the place up. Had over 1000.00 worth commisionary goods. Sure am tired tonight. Got a letter from Sam yesterday - said you were worrying cause I hadn't been writing. Having sweep weather another month with bring the summer.
Sure got a lot of work ahead of me to get straightened out. Guess I'll be OK in couple days though.
This job pays $30.00 and board. If I stay here this summer will be getting 40 by then.
Only have 30 men in this gang. I have to keep track of their meals and purchases and charge them for it. Sales amounted to 18.00 yesterday. Will get my first pay the 15th of March. Have about $12.00 coming. Sure going to try and save a little if I can. May stay with this job for quite awhile and again may not. Tell better when summer comes.
Well will close-feel awful sleepy.
Sure like to hear from all of you often.</p>
<p>Will write Regularly Now
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dearest Folks,
Gee wish I hadn't told you not to write sure miss the mail. Expected to get out by first of month but account of work closing down on Union Pacific all the men came down here so I may be here a week yet. want you all to write me right away. Am enclosing letter from Ft. Worth so you see I can't tell exactly when I will get out. Having pretty good time. Gained 12 pounds since being down here and feel fine. Sure have good meals.
I put out pretty good washing today. Washed bed clothes beside my clothes. Last 5 days sure have been swell. Couldn't ask for better weather. I'm 5 miles out from Denison now but still get mail at Denison-K-18-
You just keep on writing and if I leave I can have it forwarded. Hope everybody is well. Is Ruth still there?
Well I don't know hardly anything to write so will close.
Hope to hear from all of you soon.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dear Sir:
Your letter of Jany 26th advising Mr. W. C. Chandler was ready to take a camp. There has not been a vacancy in which we could place Mr. Chandler. Please advise him we have not forgotten him and will place him just as soon as an opening develops. We are expecting some new camps to open in the near future and will no doubt be able to use him soon. but just at this time cannot say when.
Yours truly,
The J.E. Hutt Contrg. Co.

Dearest Folks,
Thought I'd write few lines this am. I've been going on so much about how warm it was and night before last it dropped to 10 degrees about zero. I was in a box car all night and it was certainly cold. I didn't go to Greenville with Mr. Coster as expected. Stayed in San Antonio another day trying to get a job. I came to Hillsboro and have been treated fine. The above company have their bunk cars here and they have me my meals and the foreman gave me a splendid letter to W.L. Hilt to help me towards getting a job. Says it don't pay very much to start but good chance for promotion for right man. Sure have reacted me like a prince. I'll go from here to Dallas and then to Greenville to get my clothes and then to Ft. Worth to see this company. Ft. Worth is close to Dallas but will have to go to Greenville to get my clothes account can't have them forwarded. With the letter I have, I certainly ought to be able to get something. Will send you a copy of the letter. It is about 20 degrees above zero this am and am sure glad I've a good warm place to stay while I'm here.
This Mr. Allen who gave me the letter hadn't know me but about 5 hours when he gave it to me. Sure is a nice man.
Well I'll write you soon as get to Ft. Worth and see what I can get. Hope everything is well and OK.
Lovingly,
Mart</p>

Dear Sir,
The bearer of this note, R.B. Brady, is a telegrapher and general rail-road clerk. He writes a splendid hand, appears to be clever, ambitious, and willing. From lengthy conversation with him and general appearance I believe he would make a good clerk and I therefore respectfully suggest that you give him a chance if you have anything.
Yours,
John P. Allen</p>

Dearest Folks,
Pretty slow traveling here. Am on First Lines. Have some thought of getting job on this line. If I do it will be permanent. They have no schedule here and when they put a man to work its permanent. Am 170 miles from Houston. If don't get job will be there Sunday or Monday.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dearest Folks,
Sure don't seem like Christmas. Leave here this pm. Probably be in Houston Tuesday or Wednesday unless land something before I get there. Lots of great sights here. Went through Louisiana State Museum yesterday evening. Sure interesting. Was also down to Wharves where they were unloading cargo of bananas. Will write again soon.
