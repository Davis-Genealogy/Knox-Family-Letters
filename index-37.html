Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
No mail since last writing. Am still on same job, getting along OK. Nothing new to write except that it didn't rain yesterday or day before. Wrote Grace and Ruby other night and will write Lorin tonight. Certainly is getting warm over here.
We have moving picture shows at YMCA every night. Mostly French pictures. I've been unable to go account being on duty all the time.
Do you get the Kansas City papers? They quite frequently publish information concerning us that I'm not allowed to mention. At least they will tell you where I am.
They printed picture of our Captain and an article telling of him being awarded Croix La Guerra for distinguished action while under shell fire. That was some time ago.
Well how goes everything on the Ca? Hope you get the raise. Think we will be paid about tomorrow (Monday). Hope so anyway. We're still batching here as I mentioned before. Generally have pan cakes for breakfast each morning. I put half gallon sugar and some water on stove yesterday to make syrup for our cakes and one of other fellows thought it was water and put soap in it and washed dishes in it. Ha Ha never did know the difference until I told him. I noticed the dishes were all sticky and when I found out syrup was missing I knew right away what had happened. You see we use the pan to cook in, then wash the dishes in it and then use it for shaving. Ha. We have one skillet and use it for frying, boiling, baking, and some times it serves as a plate to eat off of.
Well must close and go to work. Will write as often as can. Don't have much time to write. Want to write Lorin tonight if get a chance. You all keep on writing.
Lovingly,
Martin

Dearest Papa, Mama, &amp; all,
Wrote you several days ago but it came back yesterday account containing too much news. Ha. Also one sent back which I had to Ruby so now I'll have to do them over. I received 2 letters from Papa yesterday. One dated in Feb forwarded from other company and one dated in April. That makes 7 letters I've received from you all in lat 3 days. Sure was mighty glad to get them. Ruby, Grace, Lorin, and Bess all wrote dandy long letters. Very much surprised to hear of Grover's marriage. Hope they get along OK. Bess told me of Lee Maynard's marriage also. Lots of the fellows under 31 getting married since last June. Ha.
Guess I can't tell you much news. My last effort was a failure have quite a bit of time tonight so guess I'll write everybody a letter. Ruby, Grace, and Bess. Has Bess gone to Wichita yet? Ruby said she was coming. Well I finally received my service record and will get my 6 months pay this pay day. It will be $20.00 shy account of an allotment that you all didn't get and therefore due me. You remember I told you last Jan that when I changed the allotment last November it cancelled the former one and the 20.00 for Nov. wasn't sent home and on the Jan pay roll it was marked due me but wasn't on the pay role this month.  Guess I'll get it next month. I can use the frances very nicely. Am out of Soviet articles. Are you getting the allotment regularly? Glad you got the insurance policy. I never have received any of the packages you mentioned having sent. Don't have the last idea where they are. Hope papa gets that raise to 12. That wont be so bad.
Were having dandy weather except for rain. Everybody has their garden in. We still draw rations and do our own cooking. Like it fine. Guess you all feel the effects of the war. Relative foodstuffs, etc. I see by the "Communique" from Paris that the 3rd Liberty loan was a grand success.
The YMCAs are going great work over here. Furnish all sorts of entertainment. There were two American girls sang at YMCA here last week. Sure was a sight for sore eyes. I notice they kept gazing at a shell hole in the roof and were rather startled every time on of our "berthas" sent over a kiss to the Kaiser. Ha.
Well I must close and get busy on the rest of the letters. Don't pass this one around cause I'm going to write them all one just like it. Ha.
Am feeling great and getting along OK. Don't worry about me. Will write again, soon.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received Mama's dandy long letter yesterday dated April 1st and mighty glad to get it. Wish you would keep them coming. I haven't received my serve record yet consequently no pay and don't have the slightest idea when I will.
Certainly is disgusting to hear about the Pro Germans around there. They should be put in jail as German sympathizers. I wish some Govt. official would hear Heddler make a remark like "Dog collars should be put on all soldiers and called Wilson's pups." That's German sympathy pure and simple. I wish some of them could come in contact with these Germans. I consider it great sport to elevate a big fat german on the end of a Bayonet and hear him squeal. They're just like their government - greedy and inhuman. I'll surely be glad when they are cleaned up which, of course, will be the eventual outcome of this war.
Nothing new to write. Getting along OK and feeling fine. If you can secure copy of Kansas City post of Mar. 14th you will see some interesting news. Grinsley might get you a copy. Hope Bill gets in good branch of service if he is selected. Wish I could have been there when the sausage arrived. Ha.
Hope you have good luck with your garden down by Quarry.
We've been having lots rain over here. Wish it would dry up. Well I must stop, all of you write and don't worry about me. I'll write as often as I can.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dear Mother
Just finished grating your stove and thought I would drop you a few lines in regards to it.
You will find the lefts for it under one corner of the stove top. There is also a package of holts in the bungle of legs to fasten them.
The burners I wired on so as to keep them from being lost. When you cut the wire which fasts them to the lids you can just lift the lid and chimney or that blue tin right off.
They cut the wires which fasten them to the lid. On one end of the burner is printed "This end up."
There is a email hold in the bottom of the burner and that goes down over the peg in the top of the burner. Ruby says you have had the same kind of an oil stove so the chances are that you will know more about it than me.
You can regulate the burner the way yu want it but the stove man said it should not be turned too high as it got so hot it would melt the stove door.
When I brought those stoves there whereas some ovens so I am sending you on of them. Expect Mr. C. will have to take it down to the Hardware store and get them to set it up for him.
Every thing is OK with us. Ruby is growing finer and better looking every day. She also is some cook.
I really don't see how I ever got along without her.
She was very much put out account Bess not coming on down here.
Guess I better cut this out as it is rather late.
Would like to drop in for a visit but don't know just when that will happen.
Ruby is eating an orange. I tried to I've her a dose of Castor Oil but was out of luck. Tell the kids all hello and that I will drop in some day. Well i guess I will close.
Love to all,
Sam</p>

<p>Dearest Papa, Mama, and all,
Received latter from Papa yesterday and was mighty glad to get it. Pretty near every mail brings in a letter from Papa. Well, theres new dope out now that we wont leave for some time. They got orders not to turn over equipment until further notice. Darn it! Seems like something comes up every time to change things. Will enclose the speech delivered us by Gen. Pershing up on Rhine last Sunday. Sure was a dandy review. Everything went lovely.
Been having some rain and snow lately but today is pretty day.
Heard rumor that we will go through France and not up the Rhine. Certainly hope it isn't true. Sure would hate to go through France. probably have to lay in France for couple of weeks if we go through there.
We don't belong to the 4th Army Corps any more. Are now 3rd Army reserve. Certainly hope we start for home soon cause I'm mighty anxious to get there. I'll be sure and fill out the blank you received from Pittsfield. Are they just for men from Pike County?
Well, haven't much time to write this and don't know much more to write. So will close. Hope you are all well
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Guess it's about time to write home. Wrote Grace and Ruby few nights ago. Had dandy long letter from Mama yesterday. It was dated 25th of September. Had been to Central post office. Got letter from Papa today dated February 24th. Certainly am tickled to get all your letters. I've been getting lots mail lately. General Pershing reviewed the division today. Everything went lovely. He also decorated some of the men with D.S.C.s. Saw in the paper other day where we were to leave here the 1st of April. Said he would go to Antwerp by rail and embark from there. Certainly hope we do leave then and I think we will. The division is turning in their equipment now and all men on leave have been ordered to return to the division by the 24th. We were dropped from the 4th Army Corps today and are now 3rd army reserve so everything points to an early departure. So Lesley Wildt is here on the Rhine eh? Certainly would love to see him. He's due to stay here for some time if he's in the Regular Army though. Glad I'm not with the 1st F.B. now. They're in the 2nd Division stationed not very far from here and guess they'll be here several months longer.
Has been pretty chilly today but it's generally nice and warm.
Golly, can hardly realize that we will be on our way home pretty soon. Guess about all of the Pearl boys are back now except Leo Wildt and myself. Lordy I'll sure be glad to get back.
Guess I'll get there in time to go fishing with Papa and Knox. Am figuring pretty strong on being in the sates by Easter Sunday. I was in Pexonne, France in the Lorraine Sector. It was a quiet place compared to the rest of the fronts we were on. Guess I wont get a chance to have my picture taken over here but will have some taken soon as I get to the States.
Well I must close for this time. Hope to be able to state definitely when we will leave in my next letter. Am feeling great. Hope you are all well.
Love to all,
Martin

Dearest Folks:
Thought I'd write a few lines tonight before going to bed. Have heard nothing yet as to when I may be able to join my company. Am anxious to get back o them so can get my mail which I'm sure must be with my Company. Last mail I received was a week before leaving the States. Also like to get my pay and my clothes. We're having great weather just like spring. Only hope it continues. This certainly is a very pretty country. Everything seems rather ancient. The buildings are all of stone - also the floors. The majority of the French wear wooden shoes. They seem to be very hospitable. I'm picking up a little French language each day. It seems a difficult language to learn. The making and transportation of wine seems to be the greatest industry among the class of people I've seen so far. I'm doing nothing now except getting on a fatigue detail occasionally. Rest of time I stay pretty close to my billet in hopes of being called out to be sent my company.
Met a Captain in a signal Corps Bat. who was formerly a Lieutenant in our Battalion. He directed me to Division signal officer who took my name and organization and said he would take it up with Chief Signal Officer in an effort to send me back to my organization but said he didn't know whether or not he could do anything. If I had my service record and description list I could be transferred into a signal corps outfit here but as it is I'll have to stay with casual outfit. I've had quite a bit of training in the states and am first class telegrapher and qualified in all of the visual signaling and I'd like to do what good I can, if any. In the Casual Company we don't do any drilling and thats why I'd like to get back in my company or else be transferred to another organization.
Am getting good meals and feel OK all the time. Only hope you are all feeling as well as I.
Intended writing Ruby and Sam before now but don't know their address. Asked you for it some time ago but of course wont know until I get my mail.
Must close and go to bed. Was on a fatigue detail all afternoon and am a little tired.
Don't write anymore until I get what mail you've already sent.
Love to all,
Martin

Dearest Bess,
Received your dandy letter this am and the invitation to Ruby's wedding and sure glad to get them. Only wish I could be there.
We were scheduled to leave yesterday but wont leave until Saturday now on account headquarters haven't got all their stuff loaded. We're sure going across this time though. I'm sorry I haven't had any pictures taken but its too late now. Didn't draw any pay last paw day so I've been broke. We might possibly get paid in Hoboken before leaving there and if we do I'll sure have some taken and have them sent home.
Lordy wish I could be home for Christmas. This will make about 4 Xmas' I've missed at home.
Guess you all have been pretty busy sewing and getting ready for the wedding.
Glad to hear Grove has a good job. Hope he stays with it.
I received Papa's letter last night. Sorry to hear they are going to take off the Helper.
Well Bess don't know a whole lot to write. We haven't any thing to do now except wait for orders to embark. All of our horses and boxes have gone. Sure hope you all enjoy a merry Christmas and happy New Year.
I'd like to have had another one of those angel good cakes before leaving but no chance now. Think they are pretty strict about sending anything to France.
Will write soon as we get over.
Love,
Martin</p>
<p>On back of last page:
Was mistaken about this being the letter which spoke of this instance. It was the letter he wrote before this one to me. When you find it wish you'd send it to me. I want to see what he said about it too.
Bess</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all,
No mail since last writing. Expecting to receive my back mail most any day. Sure be glad when it comes. Nothing new to write about. Still having mild weather.
Am working in Message Center here. Recording correspondence, telegrams, etc.  Doesn't require much clerical ability. Work from 8 am to 5 pm and in addition, work half night every fourth night. Don't have much to do at night but keep pretty busy during the day. have a good warm place to sleep. Getting good meals here. Have been feeling extremely good past month.
Notice in paper when they are busting men out of service, at a rapid rate in the states. Will certainly be glad when we get back. Don't have the least idea when that will be. Hear lots of rumors but, of course, one can't believe them. The A.E.F. has got an Old Maids sewing circle backed clear of the map when it comes to starting rumors.
Was much surprised to hear of Colonel Roosevelt's death. The Country will sure miss him.
Our signal Corps Radio picks up the states, Russia, Honolulu and many other places. Get lots of press from the states.
The German people treat us very good. Do almost anything for a fellow. Guess they're depending a great deal on the U.S. helping them out in the future.
Well must close for this time. Hope you are all well. Will write again soon.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received the box of candy and cake yesterday in good condition. Lordy it certainly was good. Twas in good condition. Nothing tasted anything better. Sure glad to get it. Was afraid it had arrived and gone to central post office with rest of my mail before I got back to my organization. I'm staying with a German family now. Have a pretty fair room. Nice and warm. The people treat me just fine. Do almost anything for a fellow.
It is rumored we will leave here about the 10th or 12th but dont have the remotest idea where we will go. Hope we go home. Gee I'd certainly love to see you all. I'm extremely anxious to see my new relations. What does Uncle Knox think of Gene and Audrey? He's a big one to be an uncle twice. Ha.
How's he getting along in school?
Expect he has grown considerably since I last saw him. I've gained about 15 pounds since the war ended. I was sure glad it ended too. Don't ever want to go through another war. Hope there never is another one. I've had all I want of war. The only part of the big battles I missed was the last part of the Argonne battle. Wish I could have been on the line when it ended. There is one German here where I stay that was in Chateau Thierry and St. Michiel Battles. Seems funny to be friendly with one who, only two months ago, was opposite us in the lines.
Soap is very scarce over here. The Germans can hardly get soap at any price. We have soap issued to us and we can also buy it at Commissary at reasonable price. Rubber is also very scarce over here. Leather is used largely as a substitute for rubber. All the German gas masks are made of leather. Still having mild weather. This Rhineland is a very good territory. Great place for tourists. Land is very fertile. Some very pretty towns in this vicinity. Will mail you some postcards of this vicinity in few days. Expect to be paid off in day or two. I have about $35.00 coming. 3 months pay.
Hope we start for home when we leave here. Lord if I ever get home! Year ago this time we were out on deck looking for submarines. Ha! It wont take near so long to make the trip back across the Atlantic as coming over. We were 14 days on water coming over. I'll never cross it again if I ever get back to the U.S.A.
Well I must close for this time. Hope to get my back mail in a few days. Will write again soon.
Hope everybody is well.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>
