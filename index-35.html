Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received 3 letters from papa in last three days and sure glad to get them. Glad to know Hulsingler wasn't looking for me but was sure he didn't have anything on me. I'll probably be here for two weeks or so longer. Getting along OK. It's getting pretty cool out here. Had 2 or 3 frosts but we never have any snow. I've been busy every evening rehearsing of an entertainment to be given by the Christian Endeavor a week from Friday. I'm to be the bridegroom in a mock wedding ceremony. Going to have it in the school house. They're having lots of music and songs too. Got a good orchestra to play for them. They're trying to raise enough money to build a new church. I went to Sell's first circus other day in San Luis abispo. Got 4 comps for putting up posters in the depot. Gave 3 of them to the agent and wife, agent has card party every once in while and invites bunch to his house. Generally serve coffee, sandwiches, and cake. He is helping the CE entertainment also. Got 2 songs to sing - He is a swell singer- One of them is "Under the Sheltering Palms" and the other "Never Let the Same Bee Sting you Twice." If they have any account of it in San Luis paper will send you the clipping.
Ralph is getting quite a stay at Rush Hill isn't he? Wonder why they don't put Micky to work.
Guess I'll write Bess a letter tonight but I wrote her last. Business isn't very heavy here now. Never have over 4 or 5 trains during the night. Had a derailment close to here other night and 3 passenger trains had to stay here all night until they got the track cleared. Well must stop now.
Will write more often after this.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all,
Received Papa's letter yesterday and sure glad to get it. Been on guard last 24 hours. Rained all night and most of the morning but, of course, that doesn't stop one from walking post. I didn't have my raincoat with me and I was soaked clear through. Awful cold too. The Radio Detachment left today for France. Again, some rumors that we will leave shortly but you can't feel a thing about it. May go at any time and again may not go at all. We wear two identification tags now. Each one has our name, rank and organization on it. One to be buried with us in case of death and the other one sent to parents. So if you ever get a little round tag with my name on it you can hang out the black ribbon. I'm not worried about not coming back. Think will make it OK in case we should be sent over. Suppose you read of the American Trouspers being torpedoed by German submarine. Fortunately it was returning and not many aboard to lose though and that's bad enough.
We are having a field meet in this camp next Wednesday. All sorts of contests. I haven't entered in any of them. Don't think I could compete very strong in any of the athletic events. We're having a wire contest though, between different Battalions to see who can set up radio station and open telegraph stations in shortest length of time. Of course I'll take part in that. Awful glad Knox's arm is mending rapidly. Hate to see him miss so much school.
A fellow in our company received a letter from one of the boys in France today. Was dated "France, September 15th" and had been censored. Didn't say a thing about their locations or of the conditions existing over there. Was over a month on the road so If I get over there and you don't hear from me very often, you'll know the reason why.
Yes it's only four more days until papa's birthday. Wish I had something to send him. Sure hope the men on Ca get a raise. Prices keep going up but not so the wages. Lordy I'd like to be back at work. Sure work in the Army. Fatigue nearly all the time when we're not drilling and drilling isn't any play. First thing after Breakfast we police up the camp. Pick up all the matches, cigarette butts, pieces of paper, etc. First call for Reville (Rev-a-le) at 5:45 am. Assembly 6 am, water and feed horses immediately after reville. Breakfast at 6:30 am then clean up camp, as I mentioned above. After get camp cleaned up we groom the horses up to 7:45 am, Calisthenics 7:45 to 8:30 am, mounted drill 8:30 am to 11 am, groom horses on return tom drill then water, feed and put on horse blankets. 1 pm to 2 pm we have visual signaling, 2 pm to 3 pm Buzzer practice. From 3 to 4 pm have nothing to do. 4 pm water and feed horses, 5 pm stand retreat and then we're all through for the day. Friday evenings we clean equipment instead of drilling. Saturday morning is inspection and Saturday evening and all day Sunday have nothing to do except grokm and feed horses. Mounted drill on Monday is tactical, tha is =, opening telegraph stations and stringing wire cross country. The company is divided up into 4 sections, each section consisting of about 14 men, sometimes not that many. Each section taken wire cart and reel out wire across country, each connecting with one of the other sections so as to establish a complete line of communication between all sections. Each section opens two stations. The first station relating all messages to next section and so on until message has reached destination. Each section forms groups of four numbering 1 to 4 from left to right. No 1 is operator, no 2 and 4 Linemen, and No 3 the horse holder. When command is given to open station the first set of four rides around to reel at cart, reel cart being in rear of each section. All dismount dn turn their horses over to Horse Holder (No.3). The operator gets a Buzzer, ground rod, pencil and pad out of reel carts and connects onto wire, thus opening first station. The reel cart then drives on feeling out wire as it goes. The do it in a gallop. The men who didn't take part in opening first station ride ahead of the feel cart in the formation I mentioned before and the two linemen follow the cart and see that the cart and see the wire is put in proper shape and no breaks. They patrol the line continually between stations bring responsible for its maintenance and if they find it broken at any point or someone has cut it they immediately replace it. Sometimes the Captain will cut it to see if the linemen are on the job. After we get through sending messages ect., command is given to close station. Then ge outs his instrument and other articles back in. Cart and the reel cart winds up on reel. Two men ride behind with pike poles (pool with hook on end so wire will slip through it) and see that it doesn't get tangled up. Doesn't take very long to string out 5 or 10 mile of wire. All sections assemble and come back into camp.
On Tuesdays and Thursday we have equilation. Think I mentioned that before. Riding without feet in stirrups, etc.  Anyway I dread it most of all. It's purpose is to train us to balnce ourselves in saddle. Wednesday and Fridays we have company drill, close order. Each section is formed in sets of fours same as in other drill except it doesn't make any difference how we are placed or whether we're number 1, 2, 3, or 4. This drill is just to teach us different formations such as "right, or left, about," "right or left front into line," "right on left flank," so that Commander on Battle field can get his company into whatever formation he sees fit by giving the command.
well it's getting pretty late so I'll close and go to camp. Can't describe very well, just what we do but its not a bit complicated.
Hope this finds every body well. I'm feeling fine, physically. Guess the fatigue we get is good for us.
Everybody write soon and Happy Birthday to papa,
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received 3 letters from papa since last writing and mighty glad to get them. Was so sorry to hear Knox has broken his arm and I'll be anxious to hear when he is OK again. That will keep him out of school too. Be sure and let me know how he gets along. Nothing much new to write except were all afraid we wont get to go to France for awhile. We're all prepared to leave but nobody know anything about when we are going. Some think the company will be split up and sent to different places as non commissioned officers to drill the National army. Everybody thought we would leave immediately and its sure some disappointment to think we might not go. Can't tell anything about it though.
I'm on guard duty now. On at 5:30 pm yesterday and off at 5:30 this pm. Do guard duty 2 hours off four hours. It's pretty cold here at nights but have good warm clothing and a dandy overcoat. I'll sure be glad to get that sweater. Overcoats are so unhandy to go out to drill but got to wear something to keep warm and that sweater will make it fine and dandy.
I just got away from the guard house for few mins to come over to YMCA and write. Hands are so cold can hardly write.
I'll be over at club tomorrow night and will write from there.
Be sure and let me know how Knox makes it. Hope rest of you are all well.
In case we leave unexpectedly will write you if permitted.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Golly Havent received any mail since being here. Thought sure would have received a letter before now. Everything going along OK. Awful chilly here but otherwise like it OK. Haven't heard anything definite as to when we will go to France but were sure going. I'm anxious to get over there. 25 Signal Corps men and 3 officers left today for Franc. 2 come over to the Signal Corps Club nearly every night. Good way to pass time away. Have a dandy Victrola and piano. All kinds books and magazines to read. Been doing lot of fatigue since coming here getting camp straightened out. I haven't been on a horse since leaving Texas but will go out tomorrow on drill. How are the children coming in school? Is the apple season over yet papa? How much does Grace's baby weigh now? Lordy I'd love to see her. Did she enter the contest at the state fair? Well guess I'll go down and finish my story. Am reading "The Dark Star" by Chambers. Have to be back in camp by 11 pm. We all drew overcoats yesterday. The sure are dandy. Will get rest of our winter clothing right away. Fitzjarrellz is over here with me tonight. You know he is the fellow I mentioned from White Hall. Does Ruby remember him? He used to go with Lucille Knox.
Well must stop. Hurry up and write.
Love to all,
Martin</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received 2 letters from papa since returning from hike last Saturday evening and sure glad to get them. We went up into New Mexico on the hike. Had a dandy time. The company was split up and strung out through the country and we had continuos wire communication which we put up ourselves. I stayed on duty until midnight. A and C company were along too. A company is the Radio outfit. They put up their wireless apparatus and were in communication with El Paso all the time. They also had a wire strung to our camp and out company relayed all messages for El Paso to the Radio Co and they sent them by wireless to El Paso and Ft. Bliss.
The man who brought Papa's letter to me yesterday saw that it was from Pearl and asked me if I knew anyone there. I told him I lived there and he said he was from White Hall. He sleeps in tent next to mine. He is a step brother of Pearl Ellis and said he remembered Ruby and Pearl were at their house one time. His name is Fitzjarrellz. He is Corporal in the company and a nice fellow. He also knows Uncle Will's family at Manchester and used to go with Lucille. Sure surprised me to meet him. Said he had been at Pearl lots of times playing ball and coming to boat shows and knows lots of the fellows around Pearl. He's the only fellow I've ran across close from home. Our battalion played baseball with 2nd telegraph battalion yesterday and beat them 7 to 3. Captain was sure pleased. I had m picture taken in ball suit with another fellow. Just a Kodak. Will send you one soon as they are finished. Mama did you ever find the Kodaks in my suit case?
Well its just 5 min until drill time and I've been writing this in an awful hurry so could get it off this am.
Hope everybody is OK. Well write again soon.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
No mail since last writing. Expect to be assigned some time this week. I never have received any mail forwarded from Sanderson yet. Should have a good bunch of it pretty soon. Did you get my cards from Juane &amp; Max? Supposed you got my pictures I sent from Sanderson. I'm still doing messenger duty over at Captain's office. Don't have much to do. My you ought to see the soldiers drilling here. They get about 3000 out on parade ground and it sure is pretty to see them all moving. They have 6 or 8 bands playing all the time. There's about 5 camps here at Ft. Bliss. Wouldn't be surprised if I was assigned to one of them. Quite a bunch of infantry have been sent out of here lately. Some to Eagle Pass, TX, some to Salt Lake City, Utah and some to Syracuse. Wish they would ship me to Illinois. Lordy wish I had come home before enlisting but they told me Tuesday (Day 2 enlisted) that Saturday was last day could volunteer so I thought I'd better get in.
I'll send my clothes home first time I go to Taylor. Got 2 suit cases full.
Sure hot down here. These uniforms are pretty warm too. Generally go to bed about 8 or 9 pm. Have breakfast at 6 am. Then after breakfast everybody helps clean up camp except men detailed for special duty. They have to pick up every match and scrap on ground and then sweep the entire camp. Some of them have to wait on tables and some work in kitchens about 5 each. I've worked both of them. Say I worked in kitchen. I peeled 4 bushel potatoes; scrubbed tables and washed pots. I've worked every job they've got here expect to clean toilets. We have a dandy shower bath here. Each of us received a Toilet kit yesterday free of charge. Consisting of towel, shaving soap, brush, razor, shoe brush, clothes brush, tooth brush and box shoes polish and a bag to keep them in. Also got package needles and some thread. We're allowed about 40.00 worth clothes when we enlist. My outfit ran about 15.00. Got 3 suits summer underwear, 3 pair socks, 1 shirt and 1 uniform and pair shoes. Oh yes, got a pair overalls and jacket too. Each of us have our own mess kit consisting of fork, knife, spoon (large), and one pan. We take pan in kitchen and they fill it up. Always have radishes, onions, bread, butter, and ice tea, lemonade, or coffee on table. I've never got up from table hungry. We wash our own mess kit and bring them in and put them away. Have a free moving picture show over a 8th calvary every night. We're free to go where we please from 5&gt;45 pm to 11 pm except Sundays and holidays. We're off all day except men detailed for special duty, as I am. I did quite a letter writing today. Took bunch papers to Camp Stewart 10 miles distant and then made several other trips on horseback and I'm pretty tired and dusty so I'll quit and go take bath.
Expect to get a letter from Papa tomorrow for sure.
Sure hope everybody is OK.
Love to all,
Martin</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received letter from papa day before yesterday and one today and mighty glad to get them. General Representative of Russia was here today reviewing our troops. They had a big parade, about 12000 soldiers. Gee it sure looked pretty. As far back as I could see was column after column of soldiers. The signal corps was up toward the front, mounted. I had a pretty good house. By golly from the way paper reads the general had better beat it to Russia. Haven't heard anything about how long will be here but couldn't be surprised if didn't stay here until next spring. It's pretty warm here in day time but the night are always cool and have to cover up. Thane good thing. Awful glad the girls got their pass to Dunlap. I'll write to them tonight in this company from Illinois. Sure seems good to see dome one from up there. What is Ralph doing? Hope he gets a job OK. I saw in paper where all the switches around Chad were on a strike. Hope it doesn't delay the girls trip any.
Well I'm in a hurry. Got to get ready to stand retreat. Will write again soon.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dear Ones:-
I'm having such a good time I can't hardly find time to write. I went to Witt and driving yesterday in the car. Grace, Lorin, and Baby also went about 50 miles it was a fine ride. Ruby I do wish you could see this sweet baby. I know but I can't express my thoughts in words. maybe Bess can tell you about her. Has Mamma come him yet? Loin and Grace have a new $200 talking machine. It is a beauty. He will have a new piano up here before long. Ruby I bet you were lonesome without anybody to go with, but Bess will soon be home.
Ruby I like my hat just fine now, but it was almost too large at first until I got the lining put in. I am going to write to Mamma &amp; Freda first as soon as I get through here. I bet Freda is kind of lonesome, has she been down since I've been gone.
I am going to Sunday School tomorrow, it will be children's day.
Loren, Bess, Lucerne, and I had our pictures taken with the baby. Loren got them today they are awful good of all of us. Grace said they were the best Kodak pictures they had eve taken of the baby.
This is all I can think of now.
Lots of love,
Margaret
If you get any letters from Mamma send them on.

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received 2 letters from papa today and sure glad to get them. Guess it's been quite a while since I've written. Been feeling pretty glum lately but OK now. It's blooming hot can't do anything. I'm sending my resignation in tomorrow and am going to work for Western Union. May come home. I'd like to get away from this hot country, nothing but barren hills. Had big sand storm today but I was in bed and didn't bother me any. Had my ears full of sand when I got up. Am sending you picture under separate cover. But you were all glad to see Bess, wish I could see you all. Suppose Mama will be home in a few days. Will mail three pictures. Wish you'd give Grace one. Started to mail one to Morrisonville but wasn't sure she was there. Guess Lucerne will have a good time in Granite. Whats Knox doing anyway? Guess he is doing lots of swimming. I haven't been swimming since left California.
Well don't know any news. Everything quiet down here. Wont leave here for week or so yet.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>
