Dear Grandma,
I'm getting along pretty well in school. How are you getting along. I would like to know what I am going to get for Christmas but I do not know yet. I will have to wait a little while. Are you coming this Christmas. I hope you will and if you do come I will be awful glad. What are you going to get me. Mother said she bet I wasn't going to get anything if I wasn't a good boy.
From your loving grandchild,
Jerry</body></html>
