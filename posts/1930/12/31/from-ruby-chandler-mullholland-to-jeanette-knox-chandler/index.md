Chandler Pearl, Illinois Return Address: Mrs. Sam Mullholland 421 E. Lewis Wichita, Kansas Wichita, Kansas December 31, 1930 Dearest Mama and Martin Received your letter yesterday also one from Bess saying John was led past with such a bad back. Said he suffered terribly the past two night. I want to write her again today. I've written Grace so maybe I'll get such debts settled before the new year. I was reminded of my position Saturday on account of dill times. He told me I had done marvelously well, etc and if I needed references to tell them to come to him. I was there just a month. I'm not going to look for anything else for we'll be moving soon. The van will go to Fredonia for out things Saturday and Sunday and we'll be in by the 8th. I hope mostly straightened up by that time. It's petty far out on N. Laurence 3701. Gene will be transferred to Central International Mediate for the new semester. That school is real close to the golf course. Sam will bring him back and forth. Sam goes to work on an oil lease for the present out 3 miles starting the 2nd. So, he is lucky to get anything as many as are having let out. Grove not Bob have anything in sight either. Those of our fame;y who have good positions are in luck sure enough. Bess Doesn't write so optimistic either but she doesn't mind any hardships where her family is connected. She surely is big hearted. Her biggest worry is John's sickness and I surely hope he improves soon. Took sick the next day after Christmas she said. Mama you didn't say if you got my box of candy. We mailed it the same time as the letter you received. I hope it wasn't lost. I was surprised about Lucille having another girl. I wonder how Aunt Belle is now? We had cards from Virginia and Dr. I didn't send one to Va. as I didn't get her address and I was too busy to get it. Mother Davis is growing weaker. A.V. [Arthur Vincent] provides a nurse and they have a girl, too. So that is all he can do. He just can't get there often on account of his work. Mother Muir is fine - makes quilts all the time but it costs them plenty to get them quilted. At least $8 a piece and they drive to Sedgewick to take them to a woman who does it for them Gene is raising the roof with his bugle. He likes to practice on it. His vacation lasts until the 4th. Ours up here is the 8th so that gives us 4 days to get our furniture straightened. I'll have to cook with electricity as we'll be out beyond the gas main and water line. But the owner says the improvements will be extended right away. The house is brick and seems to be nice enough. Will tell you more about it after we get in. This house belongs to another concern Sam is interested in and the partner seems  very anxious for us to get in and look after things. The advantage in going there is the rental is free and that means a lot at preset. You surely have had some game, haven't you? I'd like to eat rabbit with you. Gene's out in the sun - bareheaded just tearing around on his roller skates. It is so pretty out. We had the one snow and the river was full of ice blocks at that time but it has been so mild for a week. I surely hope it will remain mild for the most of the winter and for your sake I hope you don't have such cold weather if you have to be in Pearl. That house is too hard for you to manage through the winter and I wish I could help you, but it will be rather difficult for me too so I'll be glad when spring comes. I surely hope Martin is better by now. Tell him he's better drop us a line. There isn't very much to write since I last wrote. Wish I had a birthday presently for you - but wishes are not very substantial. Anyway I hope you keep real will till your next birthday and hope to see you before your next. Love to both of you, Ruby, Sam, and Gene</body></html>
