Dear Nettie, Annie, and children
I received a short note from Nettie yesterday eve. Was glad to find by it that you were all well as this leaves us all at present. Altho the folks are somewhat disappointed. Nettie wrote a letter to Willie which were received same eve he left. Thot you folks were going to be here, but he had already gone before your letter got here. Still they expected you all the same as you never contradicted your statement to him. I came nigh down to White Hall on Wednesday eve. When you did not get here on the noon train thinking you would be like on the 12 o'clock at night but did not go but concluded to staying up here until the 12 o'clock train would come but still you did not. Just in appearance I hope all is for the best. I got a letter from Willie dated 29, that was the first I've had from you to know what you had done. He said you were undecided whether you would come till after the 4, but thought you would come with Quincy the same you went, and thought he probably would come see you right now and though he probably might come too, but today I received a letter from him from Dosmoine's, of date July 1st. He was sent there as a assistant to some delegate to the state convention. He says he has met several acquaintances . Speaks of a Dr. Clark who resides there formerly of Freemount. Speaks of a J. M. Hammond showing him great favour. He says yes and Annie will think he has forgotten you as he promised to look up the best route for you to come. I sent him a letter to Sidney yesterday thinking he was as likely to get it there as any where. As he told me that he and Hatten had played out. He told me that he would quit before he left he thought we or they are making large preparations here for tomorrow. It is said there will be a very large crowd here they are coming from Manchester Roadhouse, Whitehall Strout, Neb., and nigh all of Milton is expected . They are fixing up pretty nice for Pearl.
There is no use bothering you with a lengthy letter as I suppose you will soon all be here. Hoping to see you all soon. I am as every your Pa.
Love to all,
DKnox</p>
<p>If you see Willie tell him I will not write him til I hear from him again.
DK</p>
