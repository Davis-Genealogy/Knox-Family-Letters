From: David Knox, To: Jeanette, Annie, and G.R. Knox

Pearl, April 2, 1886
Dear Nettie, Annie, G.R., and children,
your combined and much esteemed letter of the 30th was received yesterday and would say that we were all very glad to hear from you all and to find by it that you were all favorably well. Excepting Annie whom you say was not as well as she might be. However you say she is better. I hope she will continue to keep so. We all keep very well except bad colds which is exceedingly common now in this locality. Caused no doubt by so many sudden changes. We are having all kinds of weather now. We had fine weather up until 29th night of March. Since then we are having quite heavy snow. It has snowed everyday since part of the time and thawed part. It has snowed all this forenoon. Now about 3 inches deep. Is now stacked up and looks as if the sun might come out and thaw. This snow makes the ground very muddy. I am in hopes these present snows will wind up the winter. Lots was done sowing out there and many was sowing. Labor is progressing here now as much so as any time although this strike is causing considerable excitement at night all the R.R. center and it is not done. Yet it does not effect this road between Chicago and Kansas City. All goes as usual so far, they are not doing any freighting between St. Louis and Kansas City except local between pints. the company has a large force here now, 125 on Quarry and 30 on at Extron. Gang working this side of Stroul, they all say here. No present word from Smith or Igora since my last communication. They are well, as there are parties from Monteguma and surroundings. Every day or two, who reports them well at last. Mrs. Laux still keeps the cottage. They all have about all the men that can keep her house, run the store himself. Jake and her could not agree. Jake kept in the saloons too much to suit. Got wild drink 2 or 3 times. Still Jake is very friendly. When he was at the fair he wanted to have Johnie with him. Johnie had to hide. So had the girls to keep out of the way to get rid of him. Aunt Annie is at Sister Betts for some time. Jim and your aunt Sarah seems to get along better. Jim seems to run the office successfully. It just suits hi. Politics is all the rage nowadays. We have candidates one or 2 each week, looking for county office. The numerous organists of this place are not in as much spirits about organs as they were. I learned a number if not all are going to go back. Just like they were lacking hold because one did others thought they would now. Some are objecting and I learned all are. I knew all would be a hoax. Folks who are not able to buy bread buying organs because they were offered time and again. When any person who was a judge said they were worthless cheap stuff. Your Ma says you must not get too lazy, so as you will be worthless when you come home. The music piece I spoke of is about all played out. The teacher was here last Tuesday none of the whole crowd. Put in a soprano but Maggie and Lula think they were to much at our house of cards. She cannot afford to spend time with 2 or 3. I will close this as I think of no more worth saying in this note. Words to Annie.
Your Pa,
David Knox</body></html>
