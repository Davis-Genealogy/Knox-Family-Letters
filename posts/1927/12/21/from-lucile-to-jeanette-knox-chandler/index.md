Dear Aunt,
We have thought of you often, wondering where you are. Father remains as he has been. We are hoping to have him home, while Kenneth is here to help lift him.
Brausford, Mother, and Kenneth each send their love and best wishes.
We'd love for you to make us a real visit and take part in our church activities.
With love,
Lucile</body></html>
