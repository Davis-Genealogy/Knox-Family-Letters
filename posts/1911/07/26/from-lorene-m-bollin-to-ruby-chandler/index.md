Dear Miss Chandler:
I suppose you are at home enjoying a good rest. I am resting part of the time but 2 hours a day I spend in coaching 2 pupils who have to make up work before school begins. I saw Emma Fay, Lusille, Ruth and Agnes as I was coming home on Friday. On Monday I also saw Anna H. in the auto with "Bill." Remember me to Bess and your sister Grace. Lovingly,
Lorene M. Bollin
Lincoln, Illinois
