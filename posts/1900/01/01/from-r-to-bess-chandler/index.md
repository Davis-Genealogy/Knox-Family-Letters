Dearest Bess:
Recieved your letter today. Been getting mail daily from home lately so the habit of expecting it has become fixed. So if you want to be real considerate of my general welfare keep the daily news stream. Some of the teachers were sating that Sophie Kendrick was going to hold exams in Mafril this year. Will let you know later. What about that London Symphony ticket I loosed my purse strings for your own sake. It's to be 19th April. Better try to come back with Mae and let's study for exams together.
Lots of Love to all,
R.
