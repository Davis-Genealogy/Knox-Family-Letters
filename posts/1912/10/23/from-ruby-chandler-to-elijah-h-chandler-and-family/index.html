Chandler and Family
Mailed From: Wichita, Kansas on October 23, 1912
<p>Wichita, Kansas October 23, '12
Dearest Papa, Mamma, and All:
We received the children's and Papa's letters yesterday, Mamma's registered and Bess' letters today so I feel especially good tonight.
I was awfully glad to get the $15.00 for Martin's suit. Will order it Saturday, then he'll get it in a week. After this month thought I will have gotten a good start and wont be so hard pressed for extra coin. We'll get a pay day a few days earlier this month on account of the Topeka trip. Say Papa I wish you'd order it right away for Ill need it the 6th and thats a short time off. order it Via Rock Island as a special is chartered for the benefit of Wichita teachers and promises to get us there in about 14 and a half hours.
I was glad Bess sent that music. I have those two you mentioned but can't locate the song book. Will tell you later what I do and what happens.
Bess, I was rather depending on you ordering my hat thru Edna, since you were going to pay me a little on my coat than $5.00. But if you can't share it, I can wait until I get my next pay and get it here the day before I go to Topeka for I can't get it right now.
Form the way your letters read it seemed you didn't get my last one for in it I asked about my hat and told you what I wanted also told Mamma on back of envelope it was ok about bed trade.
If you can't order hat thru Edna I'll first get a sailor for I'd have to pay a sum for beaver and trim it like I want it. Ethyl and I rented a piano and it was moved in last Sat. so I feel so much more at home. I was first crazy about before I got it. I sure will put in the time. Martin learned to play "Rock of Ages" clear thru with both hands. He's awfully proud of it. ha! He's onto Mae's now. I had to go to Teacher's Association and a dinner afterwards so he went out there. I had him go to a "Delicatessen" right near us, for his supper and go out there afterwards. I haven't seen her since Sunday but called her up this noon and she said she'd be down after school tomorrow. I did quite a washing last night and ironed this a.m. before I went to school so as to be ready for that down tonight. I wore my white veil and a tight red low made from the ribbon on my summer hat, put it right in the back. It looked good. I had several compliments. You know, my veil dress split in 3 or 4 places and I took it to Boston Store and showed them and they gave me $2.50 due bill for material. So I got a wide insertion and set it in which also lengthened it just enough. I'm quite proud of my handiwork. I still have $1.00 of that left. Not in money but due - bill. It will come in handy sometime.
I am going to a show this week and wear my light blue dress. Ethyl had a fit over it. I agent been ad it on yet. I will be the first show I have seen, not even the princess. Sam is join got take me to Forum Friday night.
I'm glad Grace got her a traveling bag. One needs it so often. Mine will come in handy at Topeka. Say, I fixed my blue dress up dandy so I can wear it all winter. I cleaned it and pressed it and put the waist back on so it looks most as good as new. I'll clean my lavender so I can take both to the convention.
Say, I have got a peachy coat. It's a mixture and has big lapels of broadcloth. It's as swell as any I've seen. It's the bicle cloth, pretty rough mostly black, so a black hat will go well with it. Bess did you get your grey beaver trimmed with pink. I saw one down town, and it would be so pretty for you.
Grace are you wearing your suit or your cast winter coat? You didn't mention so I wondered. Your blue suit was pretty on you.
The children's letters were so cute. I can read them over and over and laugh every time. It sure tickles Martin to hear what Knox says. He says "Don't you wish we had him here." I have thought so often how much good it would do one of the little girls here with we while they were out of school so long. I want them to have music so bad. After awhile I'm going to ave Martin play. He wants to so bad and it seems easy for him.
I forgot to tell you how I paid for my coat. Why since I'm a teacher I can run a bill, so whatever is absolutely necessary I can get there anytime. It came in handy for I needed it so bad when I got my dresses, I still wear my suit lots but its so hard to keep my waist ironed. I had them rough dried at the Steam Laundry also sheets, pillow cases and table cloths and Martin's collars, came to $0.47. I'm going to have them laundered every 2 weeks, then do my own ironing. It's sure worth that much and more to have them clean.
I have some of the cutest pictures Mae and I made. Cut out magazine pictures and pasted them on gown mats. Some are of Sat. evening pasts. Adds lots to my room.
I made some dandy corn fritters for supper last night and had some left for dinner today. It's so handy having some thing already fixed for quick brunch at work. The mail usually comes at noon and I have a time popping from stove to letters getting them read.
I'll sure take time to write Aunt Sarah later also to Pearl. Girls I've had several cards from Irvin Pounds with his address - gentle hint! Guess I'll write him too.
You've asked so many time about color of Martin's suit and I forget to answer. He wants brown mixture and its very popular too. A sort of red brown then he wants brown shoes before he comes home so of course I'll be able to get them then. He takes real good care of his appearance - as good as possible. He can spend a good deal time at Mae's or over to Sam's (he usually does) while I am at Topeka and sorts rough about for his meals down here. I feel safe enough about leaving him so much with Sam. They're pretty good roomies. And he likes Mrs. D.D. too she jollies with him so much. Don't mention anything about being afraid to leave him in your letters but you might tell him to make the best of everything while I'm away. I know where he is every minute for he gets out a certain time and I know he doesn't waste much getting here. he looks fine and never coughs one, since he had that cold.
Grace, it's about time you were writing again. I'd like to write lots more but will have to go to bed its 11:20 and I was up late last night. Guess I'll write on the other side tho. Say Mrs. Mussenbach  must want her fame as a poctiss to spread abroad. I saw two in the paper last week. Guess I'll send Carrie a card, and put my address on it. Hers is just Woodriver but I'll put c/o Washington School, Cleveland Ave.
I'm rather anxious to know the outcome of the settlement, so is Mae. Art asked Mae what she was going to do with her half. He's pretty busy making Xmas presents. Guess he don't want the worry of it right at the last. Must close. Write as often as you can. It's a deal to look forward to after school hours to expect mail. I think thats why Martin rushes home so.
Love to All,
Ruby</p>
<p>Last but not least - Thanks for $15.00</p>
