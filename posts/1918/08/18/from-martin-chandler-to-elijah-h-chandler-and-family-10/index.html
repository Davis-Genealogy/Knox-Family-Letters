Dearest Papa, Mama, and All
Receive the big letter yesterday enclosing all your letters and was mighty glad to get it. Also received a letter from Bess and once from Papa so you see it was a big day for me. I've received several letters from Papa since last writing. Haven't had much chance to write during past month. Have lots to tell but can't write it. Have had a lively time since last writing. At present I'm back with the 107 Battalion but was with the Iowa boys during the excitement. They sure are some scrappers. They kept the "Luns" traveling right along.
Was surprised to hear of the Garrison - Thurman affair. as there any legal action taken on either side?
Certainly would love to be home while you are all there but don't want to come until its over here. Hope it ends by winter. Te British, French, and American troops have got em on the run up their way.
What organization will Betts be in? So Rollin has decided to farm eh? He sure is good.
I lost one of my best pals lately. He and I had worked on Radio job since last April. He was well liked by all who knew him and it was a blow to all of us. He sure did his but though sure was a good man and didn't know what fear was.
We're having very good water over here. This is the most beautiful county I've ever seen. Lines of big trees on both sides the road and they certainly keep their roads in good shape. I'm camped on a river at present in a park with lots big shade trees. Am sleeping in a shelter tent and the river affords a good place to jump in every day. The nights are real cool which makes it great for sleeping.
hasn't rained any for quite a spell which is saying quite a bit cause it generally rains every day or so. One night, which advancing, we marched several miles over a road in mud up to our knees and about every 10 minutes some of us would slip and face down. The Germans had been moving their artillery, etc., even the road and that couple with the rain, sure made it a nice route to travel. It wasn't one of the main roads or I would have been in better shape. One could hear some shocking language along the way that night and they certainly had a right to cuss. Ha.
We've certainly done a lot of traveling on foot. Don't think I'll ever complain if I'm forced to walk a few miles when I'm back home, especially without a 50 pound pack on my back and a heavy pair of hob nail shoes to walk in.
We're getting good feeds and taken all around, in good shape.
So sorry to hear about poor Aunt Sarah. Hope things go easy for her. She was the very last person I saw in Pearl.
I ran across Jim Dalton other day. He was in this battalion for a while but later transferred to the engineers. I recognized him first thing and hadn't seen him for 12 years. Papa will remember him. At least he should cause he had to get up one morning at 2 am and go down and work for him. He said to give you his "73."
Let me know what batch of service and what organization Sam gets in when he is called - also Ralph, if he is called- believe you said Wade was in 317 San. Jr. didn't you?
Well I must close. Will soon be dark. I'll try and answer all those letters soon as I can. Was certainly glad to get that letter. I'll address Ruby and Sam at Wichita (811) and Grace and Lorin at Morrisonville and they can have them forwarded.
Hope this finds you all feeling as well as I am. Will write again soon.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>
