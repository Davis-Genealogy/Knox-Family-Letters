Mailed From: France on November 7, 1918

France Nov. 7th
Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Just a few lines tonight while have plenty of time. Not much news to tell. You've all read of the papers and can see that the war is just about over. I've sure been thinking a lot about home lately and I'll be glad to get back, after being gone since December 1915. I'm leaving hospital tomorrow or next day. AM feeling great. AM very anxious to get back to my organization so can get my mail. Ought to be quite a bit waiting for me. I've written the girls at Wichita since being here also Grace and Lorin a couple of times. Haven't had any very cold weather here yet but of course its hardly time for real winter yet. You have read of the terms of Armistice signed with Austria and Turkey. Rather stringent aren't they? But no more than right though. Think thats about the same conditions that will secure peace for Germany. It practically amounts to unconditional surrender and theres no way out of it for Germany but to accept. 'Twould only be to her fault to continue the war as the Allies are in a position now to completely crush her. The Americans have been doing some very hard fighting since September. I'll never forget the Argonne Woods nor any of the other fronts as far as that goes, but north of Verdin has been the American troops hardest fights and they have shown what they can do.
Would like to get home in time to get some pickled peaches, Blackberry Jam, etc. Which I know Mama has put up. I'd like to be sitting around that base burner cracking black walnuts or eating apples tonight.
Papa how goes everything on the Cra.? Suppose though I'll find out soon as I get back to the outfit and get my mail. There'll be six letters from papa to every one from somebody else. Gee-You'll soon by 64. Wish I could be there the 24th. We'd go quail hunting sure. How's Knox getting along? Suppose he will have grown so that I'll hardly know him.
Well I must close. I'll write you just as soon as I get back to the Co. Hope you are all well.
Lovingly,
Martin
