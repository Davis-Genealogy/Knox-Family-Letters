Dec 30th, 1918
Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Well I finally got back to my organization and consider myself extremely fortunate in getting back. Left town Christmas, hiked part of day and rode in a box car for next two days. There were 32 of us in a  car. A french box car is about half as large as ours. We were packed in like sardines. Hardly had room to sit down. Had salmon and hard tack for Christmas dinner. Expected to get my mail upon arrival here but it was all forwarded to Central post office. So guess I'll have to wait couple weeks more before getting my mail. Just my luck. Well anyway I'll get my mail regularly from now on. It's not like being in a confounded casual camp.
Germany seems a much nicer country than France. Everything is more up to date. The people all treat us very cordially but of course its for their interest to do so cause they're depending on Uncle Sam for food.
Our chief signal officer, colonel Garrett predicts that we will be in the states by middle of February. Certainly hope his prediction is correct.
Expect to go to work on Radio  job tomorrow. Have been busy last two days putting up the radio set. Have an "E-10" set. It's for both undamped and damped wave. It is only for reception. Want to get the various official "Communiques."
Our Divisional Radio set copies England, Russia, United States, and all the nearby countries. IT was made by Sergeant in "A" company. Entirely homemade.
I've had no experience whatever with an undamped wave set, my experience being confined totally to the type "A" French (Damped Wave) set - but all I have to do is receive and I know I can put down anything they send.
Having very mild weather here for this time of year. Much more pleasant than in France. Also have better places to sleep. In France we generally had a cold barn, while here we have a regular place and the German's furnish light, heat, and straw for our beds.
We have 5 hours drill each day but I wont have to do that on account being assigned to special duty.
Expect to get some mail from you all during interval of two weeks. I'm waiting for my back mail. Hope so anyway - Haven't had any mail since 1st of October. Received pay for month of September when I arrived here. They had held it. I had signed pay roll for September before leaving for hospital but wasn't paid so received it when I returned. Will get pay for October, November, and December on next pay role - that is - if they put me on pay roll. My service record was also sent away but think they have enough dope here to put me on pay role.
I don't know how my allotment stands. Made allotment Sept 1st, 1917 effective for one year and in July 1918 they brought out new form to sign. Couldn't make but $15.00 allotments through government and  any additional amount was to be made through the Quarter Master. I made $15.00 through government and $5.00 through Q.M. in July but don't know for how long it is effective. Will find out when my service record gets back. I'm being paid at same old rate so guess the allotment is still good.
Well must close for this time. Write you all again soon as I hear from you. Am feeling fine and dandy. Have gained few pounds during past month. Hope this finds you all well.
Lovingly,
martin
