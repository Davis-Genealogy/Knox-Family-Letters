My dearest Mama, papa, Sam, Ruby, &amp; Baby Jean, Loren and dear little Audrey, Grace, Bess, Martin
The Davis Knox bless his little heart I only wish I could see him and all and see what you all got for this Christmas and wish one and all a merry christmas and a happy new year. To begin with I am glad that you thought of Barwick to send here the box of homemade candy and I wrote and told you that I wanted you to be sure and send Dr. Marselus a box of men's handkerchiefs and a neck tie cause he has been mighty good to me. He has acted as a father to me. Tell Lucerne Margaret hello for me and I thank you for what you have sent me for Christmas. I had some pop corn, candy oranges. They decorated the ward and had an entertainment and which the songs struck me - Jesus lover of my soul - it was like a funeral to me cause I thought of my folks. Tell Vinnie Virginia, Dr. Johnston and all I wish they would come and see me as Vinnie used to say dear Anna belle going to school. I only wish I could see cousin Ima Groover. Tell Ima I sure wish she could write and I sure will answer back.
Tell Sam, Loren, May &amp; Dickie Robert art Uncle Wills as he is doctor also Aunt Belle Lucile Russell Kenneth. Baby oh yes you forgot to send barwick the pink scarf I ordered. Dr. Marselius said to em the other day sit down and be quiet. What do you know about that what would you think if he operated on me for adenoids as I need it done. You know that I had the goiter taken off my neck and my chin. What a scar it left when I fell down the stairs steps when I was a child and I thought I was dead sure enough the way I was cut on a hatchet. Eva Hayden is still here and she got lots of Christmas from her folks, some from Milton. Irene Heavmer is till here and she and Eva, I, I mean your little daughter Anna stick together same old girls and also Rose Sweenet has been good to me. I still wear her rings same as ever. How is Joe Maynard. Coming it tell him I said hello and be sure and write to me and tell all about the Christian Sunday School. Which I am a member and was a protege. Oh yes tell Brother Bolman he had better come and see me cause I thought of him many times and wondered where he was at. My dear little sister Edith Adeline and little brother Forest laying in the grand yard waiting for me t follow up in my fort and stone ready for me a green pond. You know that my age is 32 years and was born on the year of 1888 and my birth day is on the 21 of Oct. Tell Clifford Clarence Hanks hello as he is my cousin and also Mr. and Mrs. dr. Chad Low and sweet little Heart wouldn't I love to see her and wouldn't I love her to death and Miss Chad Low hello and all be sure and write to me. You remember I had influenza pneumonia. What a lot of sickness I have had a siege of it. How is Ruby since she had it. Has her hair come in think yet from influenza. What hospital would you like for Dr. Marselius to send me to the passionate that is the one that Ed Bolin was taken to and they sent his body back to Milton and buried and that is where my grandma grandpa and auntie and cousin Myrtle and all the rest of my folks are laid at the French yard and my Uncle Isaac Chandler buried at Phoenix, Arizona where they have a big Christina church. How is Aunt Anna David and wife and Margaret and the little fellow. John tell them to be sure and write. Poor dear old dad I sure would love to see him, Sam, Loren, Audrey, Grace, Bess, martin as he was a soldier and now telegraph operator and papa ticket agent for the C &amp; A railroad. How is cousin Maynard of Okla. Tell him to write. Barwick has got some Christmas for me and be sure and send them what I told you to for Dr. Marselius. A box of mens handkerchiefs neck tie cause he sure is good to me what would I do without him. One nurse sure thinks of me after I got my Christmas bless her little heart Anna Chandler what do you know about her and Dr. Murray is another good doctor well as I have run out of anything to write and tell you about I will close and bring this letter to a final close. Hoping this find you all well and happy wishing you all a merry Christmas and a happy new year and hoping that Santa Claus has been good to one and all. I am as ever your loving little girl Anna Chandler
