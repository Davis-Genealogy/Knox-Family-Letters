Dearest Papa, Mama, &amp; all: -
Guess you think it's about time I was writing - Bess and I just got back from Sunday School. We took a spurt this am and got ready and went to the Presbyterian SS and everyone treated us so nice we are glad we went. bess is correcting some papers and making out some examination papers and I have dinner on cooking. Did think I would come in and play the graphonolia but thot I would be making better use of my time if I write home.
Ruby left yesterday morning and we sure miss her. Bess and i took her to the train, had to get up at 6 am so we could have breakfast and get to the depot by 6:58 am.
Bess and i then came home, cleaned the house real good and she had to go to a teachers reading circle at 2 pm. I dusted and scrubbed after she left took a bath and dressed up again and went to meet her. Got there in time to hear part of the work. We walked up town again went to Callie's and she insisted on us staying and having supper. So Lorin came in on the 6:30 pm train and we went to meet him and all took supper there. Then went to the picture show. Lorin bought me the most beautiful purple velvet tricornered hat for my birthday, he said, but that isn't until the 6th of next month. So he was in plenty of time - Ha. My white coat just got back this am from the cleaners, so you make know I wore my new hat and white coat to S.S. and felt quite dressed up. Bess cleaned her lack suit yesterday and wore my other purple hat.
Our electric washer came yesterday pm and Lorin got up early this morning and had it in working order by the time we got up. It sure us a peach and I'm tickled we have it - will sure save my back.
Lorin is going to Taylorville to get out car today, had to leave it up there the last time he was up there, on account of some man running into him and busting it up some. Will cost about $30 to get it fixed up again. Lorin sued him for $200 - the trail comes up next week. Hope he gets what it will cost us. The car is alright now so he is going to get it today.
I am cooking apples whole not peeled, with such red skin, also sweet potatoes, kraut pork &amp; wieners. Have raw tomatoes with mayonnaise dressing for dinner.
How is papa? You said he was not feeling well when you last wrote. Hope is better by now. Guess Margaret &amp; Lucerne will have a great time in St. Louis. Lorin said I could go, but I don't believe I want to. It would be different if he and Bess could both go.
I was surprised Leta &amp; John stayed in Pearl to spend their honeymoon. Guess they have gone to St. Louis by now.
Mon. P.M. Guess I'll finish this and get it mailed. After dinner yesterday we drove to Taylorville with Oren Bloxom and another fellow, attended a football game, and drove our own car back home. Oren Bloxom came back with us - He's a Taylorville boy, and is going to be a lawyer. Bess entertained him until his train time. I was so tired, Lorin and I went to bed. I had lunch for all.
Lorin forwarded two letters to Ruby this a.m. I told him to send them to Pearl I was afraid she wouldn't get them if we sent them to Granite City.
I pulled the pears, Ruby will be glad to know and have just finished two gallons of pear butter. I had them on hand for over two weeks, so you may be sure I'm glad they're cooked up.
Lorin is going to put up the base burner this afternoon. It isn't very cold yet but he thought he'd better put it up while he had time.
Bess said at noon that she must write home. I told her I had a letter started.
She has four sets of papers to correct this evening after she comes home. She'll be pretty busy this week with giving examinations and correcting papers.
I wish papa could come up if only for a few days, might do him good and we would be tickled to death to have him. Some of you could get a pass and come up anytime. Well this is all I can think of for now. Lorin will be down around that part of the country next week, I suppose.
Write when you can, we're always ticked to hear from home.
Much love to all,
Lovingly,
Grace
Tues. A.M. -
Am sure going to get this mailed this morning. We have a train out of here for St. Louis at 3:37 P.M. and Lorin was just saying at the breakfast table that we could go down and see the Veiled Prophet tonight and get home on the midnight train if Bess could get her Supt. to teach for her half hour. So no telling we may be there tonight ourselves. The matter is to be settled at noon after Bess talks with the Supt. and Lorin is to study it over.
Write soon.
Grace</p>
