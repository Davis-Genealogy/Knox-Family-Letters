<p>Return Address:
After 5 days, return to
1201 S. Main St.,
Jacksonville, Ill.</p>
<p>My dear Mrs. Chandler:
Your communication in reference to the parole of your daughter, Miss Anna Chandler, has been received.
In reply I beg to state that inasmuch as you were not able to give her proper supervision when she was living at home with you we do not deem it wise to parol her. I understand that your daughter Bessie May Chandler is working at Pittsfield, Illinois and is making good and probably she would be able to do something for her sister, by taking her away from her old home and surrounding. I would be pleases to have you take this matter up with your daughter and if she can give Anna proper supervision away from the old environment, where she got into difficulty we might consider your application again.
Thank you for the communication, I beg to remain
Yours very truly,
E.L. Bill
Managing Officer</p>

<p>Newspaper Clipping Attached:
"Marriage of First Cousins in St. Louis is Annulled
Mrs. Clara G. Howard-Kramer Testifies She and Husband Married in Ignorance of Law.
An annulment was order in Circuit City today of the marriage of Clara G. Howard-Kramer, 18 years old, and Joseph A. Kramer, 22, of 3814 Page Boulevard, on the ground that they were first cousins.
Mrs. Kramer testified that they married in ignorance of the law against first cousins marrying and that as soon as they found this was true they separated. They were married March 4 last."</p>
<p>April 20, 1920
Mr. John Roush,
No doubt you will be surprised to get this letter from me, but I thought I would do different from the way you did, and not walk in on you without giving you word of my intention on coming to Dunlap in the near future. That is if nothing happens here to prevent my leaving home, such as something pertaining to Annie. I am sick with worry and humiliation on account of the estrangement of members of our family, and you are the cause of it all. I am coming to Dunlap to make some inquiries about some things I want to know, also to see some of the Masons there, as I intend to inform them of your actions in bringing disgrace and sorrow to a brother Mason and his family, I am also an Eastern Star. I don't want to write letters to them. So will go see them. I do not intend to be there more than a week at the most. And don't expect to enter your home. I am enclosing clipping for your careful perusal. I am still,
Your Aunt</p>

Pearl, Illinois</p>
<p>Monday A.M.
Dearest Folk,
Rather slow acknowledging receipt of the little suit. Thanks so much-came when I needed it most. It fit to perfection-as if you'd had him there. He looks so sweet in it. Jean is a good little boy and so bright. In fact, we all idolize him. It is so very long till you'll be coming and I'm so anxious for you to come. Hope this finds you all well. Vinnie leaves here Wednesday I think. Sam left this A.M.
Lovingly,
Ruby</p>

<p>Thanks so much for lovely bread. I'm afraid to keep both these buckets for fear you can't send any more.
Mon, eve.
My dear Aunt Nettie,
The bucket of bread arrived safely Sat eve and it was surely lovely. I had buns for dinner today-hot-Dr, said, "is this Aunt Nettie bread or did you make it?" "I said I made this," as soon as he tasted it he said "yes and you're telling one too" - I couldn't make him believe I'd became such an expert so quick. The next day after I came home from Pearl I began to dig into Dr.'s clothes and see if I couldn't find some things Uncle E.H. could wear - and found two right decent looking suits and a shirt. Frank was afraid Uncle Lige wouldn't like it. I told him I knew you all better than that and I'd sure take a shot at it anyway if he would send one of these to LA and have it cleaned and pressed, it would make a dandy suit. They have got two tight for Dr. since he's getting so plump. I intended sending the things by Bess but they wentÂ by while we were at church. I do hope Uncle can wear these clothes as I know they will help some, and it is good material in the suits. Frank has two or three polo shirts (white) with collars attached. Does Uncle Lige want near these shirts- These are good too but I'm afraid they would be big in neck. I'm going to put on in and see. If he can't use it maybe Bess could make Knox a shirt out of it. I am sending Annie the beads when any one goes or you send. I can get a dark red satinÂ at 50 cents per yard at bat. Must get this to P.O as mail leaves so early. Aren't you tired of now? Bess is coming up soon isn't she? Am looking for her. Lots of love to all.

Pearl, Ill</p>
<p>White Hall, Oct. 2, 1919
Dear Sister and Family,
Your letter received. It was a very pretty wedding, pronounced the prettiest. Belle was quite sick yesterday, is still sick but decidedly better. Is up and down now, supper time. She has been on a strain for two or three weeks but as you say, she is near her month and sister which means much of us. I have started papers to Anna, Ruby, &amp; Grace. We were much disappointed that Bess did not come and have wondered what prevented her from coming. The girl's associate friends of Lucile gave her several social gatherings and in each was nicely remembered. At last meeting for her at the Star, she was surprisedÂ with a beautiful Seth Thomas Mantel clock. A package came today from Princeton, Ill. a former M.H. Girl's Associate.
Annie's improvement will be great compared with her condition at home, but her completely recovery is very doubtful. I don't believe those in charge would cause her to work, it is possible, they may require her to look after her room, but they sure would not take her to any church, not of her choice, she would have the privilege of choosing her church. I don't know whether or not, there is a chapel of the Institution. If so, it would be open to all denominations. I don't believe there is. I am sorry indeed that John &amp; family have had much to say concerning Annie's affliction. In my last letter to John, I told him that it appeared to me that they were looking out for little things - and when they seemingly appeared looked like mountains to them that can be the trouble any how? I told him I expected him &amp; Bertha with us the day we were there, but learned that they were there after our leave and I wondered if it was our presence that kept them from coming? I have not heard from hims since, I told him with only 4 of the family left, we ought to get along in peace and notÂ be continuously suspicious of the other. Lucile and husband are in Davenport and Rock Island this week, arrived there Friday eve. Her Aunt Metta Chapin-Green is or has been living in Rock Island and are moving to Davenport. Green has been best cashier of the Rock Island Savings Bank until October and was chosen for Cashier of the 1st National Bank of Davenport and they are moving this week to Davenport. Also in Davenport, Lois Maine-Rilling, Lucile's companion in school in Manchester, started together and graduated together, her husband is a preacher, pastor of Presbyterian Church. Strange coincidence that both should marry preachers. They go to his father's home at Cerro Gonda tomorrow, the 3rd and from there they go to Sadorus, his appointment - for next Sunday. They will return here next week.
They took the midnight last Wednesday night for Chicago, selected furniture there through Mr. Fox. Today is the 1st day of the Annual Corn Carnival at Milton, would like to have gone for part of one day, one would meet many old time friends that it would be a pleasure to see and get new acquaintances.
Dr. Vinnie insisted that we come, Dr. thought I could not afford to miss that, but I miss many things.
Friday - I failed to have this ready for mail before time passed, here's a day late. Belle about same as yesterday, very week from attack of Thursday - is up and down Â - mostly down - the sugar proportion serious. No sugar in market and fruit going to waste. The US Senate should have quit playing politics two months or more ago and done business for the people, in ratifying the Treaty League and the settlement of International Affairs. Read the article, "The Shantey Problem" in paper sent yon by Danskin - a Rep - it covers the Senatorial dissatisfaction entirely. While writing these lines Dr. McDouglas,Â wife, niece Bess D, and husband just called, on their way to Milton. On the road met with a man who throwned them to top of car, and make a cut over my Dr. eye and they stopped for me to attend it. Dr. Will and I were in Sidney, Iowa together and great friends. It has been a long time since I have seen him, saw her this summer. She was attending a church missionary meeting in this County of District and called on one when going through. Both he and her received quite a jolt, he was knocked unconscious for a few moments, her cut caused bleeding freely and dress sprinkled. She is joyful, happy being, even with disfigured eye, black at that, and will show more black today.

My Dearest Mama,
This is Mother's day so I wanted to write you a few lines: a year ago today I was in Lorraine but I didn't write you a very long letter. I don't know just what to write now but I'm mighty glad to have a Mama to write to even if I don't write much.
Have been making preparations to leave for past two days. They say we will get out either tomorrow or next day so I think I can be pretty sure of being home next Sunday cause they say we will be discharged 2 hours after arrival in demobilization camp. There have been several train loads of men going out of here each day since I've been here. Seems like I've been here a month but only landed 2 weeks ago today. Gee but I'll certainly be glad to get home and see you all. Have moved to another casual company here and they feed fairly well. I'll be glad when I'm through with this army. I wouldn't follow the army for a living if Â they paid ever so much.
I'll bet Knox is a big boy now. And just think-I've a nephew and niece that I've never seen. I hope they look like their mother. I think Lorin and Sam were pretty lucky, don't you Mama? Believe me, it isn't everyday you find girls like yours mama. I'm certainly proud of my sisters.
Been raining here a whole lot lately. Makes it very muddy and slushy outside. We have a good place to sleep. Have a bed sack filled with straw and a good spring bed. Have breakfast at 7 am. Don't have to stand reveille or any formations. That doesn't make it much easier though. When a fellow gets to the states he doesn't want to lay around in a Casual Camp especially in a town like Newport News. All they look for is a soldier's money.
Well, Mama, will close for this time. Here's hoping I'll be home sometime this week. Am feeling great will wire you all from camp I'm discharged in.
Lots Love,
Martin</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all,
Well I'm in another camp now. Was sent there from Camp Morrison. Most of the Signal Corps went to Camp Funston, Kansas. They were from Kansas City. Darn the luck--there was a bunch of fellows went to Camp Grant, Illinois yesterday, but I was billed for Texas and couldn't go with them. I went to our Company clerk and told him I wanted to go to Illinois and he said they would send me there but found out later that I would have to make request for reclassification and make affidavit that my home was in Illinois so that knocked me out of going yesterday. I made out the request as soon as I got to this camp and fixed the affidavit up but don't know just when I'll get out of here. Probably in two or three days. Sure having lovely weather. Sure wish I was home. Would like to go finishing. Bunch of men got out of here today going to North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Nebraska. As soon as they get a bunch for one state they send them out. Hope some men for Illinois gets in here soon. Sure hate to lay around this camp. I worked hard yesterday and last night on our service records getting them filled up to date so the men could get out. Worked until midnight last night. Had to make out final endorsements, fill out cards etc., am all through now. Don't feed very good here. I ate three meals in Newport News but they cost so darn much that I haven't gone down any more. That Newport News is a good deal worse than France for robbing the soldiers. A lady charged me 75 cents other day for sewing on three service chevrons. I didn't suppose it would be more than ten or fifteen cents cause it didn't take more than three minutes to do it. I told her she had just as well stand at the door with a gun and take the money as they came in. Then I went to the barber shop and got a haircut and shave and they charged me $1.25. Lord but they sure do rob a man. Frenchmen are angels compared to these robbers. Well I hope I'll soon be home. There are so many soldiers coming in here that it doesn't excite the interest of the people here at all. You'd think you were landing in some foreign country as far as the people evincing any interest in your arrival is concerned.
General Clark, adjutant General of Missouri was out to the Battalion at Camp Morrison other day and made a talk to the men. Said Kansas City was preparing a great reception for the signal corps, but of course that means the Kansas City men. They wouldn't have had any signal Corps if it hadnt been for the causals that were transferred into it. The Kansas City men proper didnt do much excel lay around at Division headquarters, most of the time away from shell fire and gas. Golly but I'll be glad to get home.
Well don't know any more to write so will close. Will wire from ou from the camp in Illinois that I'm sent to when I will leave there. Hope you are all well
Lots love to all,
Martin</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Well guess I'm stuck here until next week - there is a shipment of men going out of here Saturday for Illinois and I tried to get in with them but they said it was full up and said I'd probably get out of here next week - Golly but it makes me sore. Here it is only Wednesday and I'll probably be here until next wednesday. I heard over in germ nay that they were discharging men 24 hours after their arrival in the US. I landed here the 27th and wont be out until about the 14th of this month. I don't see why in the dickens I can't go with that bunch Saturday. This sure is a rotten camp. Don't get hardly anything to eat -I'd like to tell this Newport News bunch just what I think of them.
Don;t do a blessed thing but lay around all day in this darned camp. Lordy - I wish I was home. I get so sore every time I think about staying here another week that I'd like to cuss the whole bunch.
Write me here. Think probably it will reach me before I leave.
I haven't written Grace and Lorin since landing cause I don't know their address. Certainly hope you are all well. Guess I'll be home someday.
Lots of Love,
