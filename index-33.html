Dearest Folks,
Rec'd Mama's letter this am addressed to me and tho't I'd write this after noon while I am resting. Washes pretty good washing this am. It is a fine bright day to dry them. Didn't think when I got up I wanted to wash but everybody else around me was washing and just hated to see them get ahead. So Lorin stayed at home and helped me and with my electric washer and ringer was all thru by 10:30. Just got up at 7:30. Wasn't that going some? But after I get all the scrubbing done I am pretty tired.
Lorin went in the car to Raymond this afternoon and to NokomioÂ if he can make it. He will be back tonight.
Sat we cleaned the house all up and washed windows inside and out. I don't think I'll do any general house cleaning. Washed the wood work around the windows and am going to rent a vacuum sweeper (electric) to clean the rugs and mattresses.
All of us, including Glenn, Thelma, bots, Callie, Allie and Chas were at Mother's for dinner and supper yesterday. Had dandy meals and a good time. Bess and I went uptown Sat pm to mail that mail you received and went on down to Callie's and she insisted on us staying for supper. Lori came home on the 6:30 train and came on down there. We stayed until 11:3. Mother send me a bunch of green tomatoes today so I'll have to work them into pickles this week. She made some dandy chow chow.
Have brot my flower baskets inside. Think I'll take out some of the best plants and pot them. Haven't much room tho for flowers. That is, not a good sunny window to keep them in.
Lorin got me a nice little trimmed oak sewing chair which is very comfortable. He bronzed my old gray shoes until now they look like new.
What is the matter with Mr. Hanks that he has to be operated on? That's too bad, hope he gets better.
Hope Martin gets to stay at the place where he is all winter. He seems to be doing pretty well.
Wonder why Bill Watters sold out in the picture show biz? Thot it was such a paying proposition? Maybe Annie was jealous of he and Roy being in together. Ha.
Glad Ruth adn Basil have gone back . The course of true love never did run smooth. Would like for her to come up and visit us. I know Bess would enjoy having her. Bess wore her new dress, hat, and shoes yesterday and looked so nice. She's so slender. Ha. I can't help but notice it.
Lorin has a nice new brown overcoat. He may be over there soon. I know he is going to make the territory around there either this week or next.
Wish we could come home Thanksgiving. I expect Bess will if she gets enough days off. I want her to so she can visit with you all and then tell me all about it.
Well this is all I can think of for now. Was glad to get Mama's letter. Hope her cold is better.
Would like to get weighed, believe I am getting heavier. Bess, Lorin, and I walked up town yesterday morning before going down to mothers. Much love to all.
Write soon,
Grace</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, &amp; all: -
Guess you think it's about time I was writing - Bess and I just got back from Sunday School. We took a spurt this am and got ready and went to the Presbyterian SS and everyone treated us so nice we are glad we went. bess is correcting some papers and making out some examination papers and I have dinner on cooking. Did think I would come in and play the graphonolia but thot I would be making better use of my time if I write home.
Ruby left yesterday morning and we sure miss her. Bess and i took her to the train, had to get up at 6 am so we could have breakfast and get to the depot by 6:58 am.
Bess and i then came home, cleaned the house real good and she had to go to a teachers reading circle at 2 pm. I dusted and scrubbed after she left took a bath and dressed up again and went to meet her. Got there in time to hear part of the work. We walked up town again went to Callie's and she insisted on us staying and having supper. So Lorin came in on the 6:30 pm train and we went to meet him and all took supper there. Then went to the picture show. Lorin bought me the most beautiful purple velvet tricornered hat for my birthday, he said, but that isn't until the 6th of next month. So he was in plenty of time - Ha. My white coat just got back this am from the cleaners, so you make know I wore my new hat and white coat to S.S. and felt quite dressed up. Bess cleaned her lack suit yesterday and wore my other purple hat.
Our electric washer came yesterday pm and Lorin got up early this morning and had it in working order by the time we got up. It sure us a peach and I'm tickled we have it - will sure save my back.
Lorin is going to Taylorville to get out car today, had to leave it up there the last time he was up there, on account of some man running into him and busting it up some. Will cost about $30 to get it fixed up again. Lorin sued him for $200 - the trail comes up next week. Hope he gets what it will cost us. The car is alright now so he is going to get it today.
I am cooking apples whole not peeled, with such red skin, also sweet potatoes, kraut pork &amp; wieners. Have raw tomatoes with mayonnaise dressing for dinner.
How is papa? You said he was not feeling well when you last wrote. Hope is better by now. Guess Margaret &amp; Lucerne will have a great time in St. Louis. Lorin said I could go, but I don't believe I want to. It would be different if he and Bess could both go.
I was surprised Leta &amp; John stayed in Pearl to spend their honeymoon. Guess they have gone to St. Louis by now.
Mon. P.M. Guess I'll finish this and get it mailed. After dinner yesterday we drove to Taylorville with Oren Bloxom and another fellow, attended a football game, and drove our own car back home. Oren Bloxom came back with us - He's a Taylorville boy, and is going to be a lawyer. Bess entertained him until his train time. I was so tired, Lorin and I went to bed. I had lunch for all.
Lorin forwarded two letters to Ruby this a.m. I told him to send them to Pearl I was afraid she wouldn't get them if we sent them to Granite City.
I pulled the pears, Ruby will be glad to know and have just finished two gallons of pear butter. I had them on hand for over two weeks, so you may be sure I'm glad they're cooked up.
Lorin is going to put up the base burner this afternoon. It isn't very cold yet but he thought he'd better put it up while he had time.
Bess said at noon that she must write home. I told her I had a letter started.
She has four sets of papers to correct this evening after she comes home. She'll be pretty busy this week with giving examinations and correcting papers.
I wish papa could come up if only for a few days, might do him good and we would be tickled to death to have him. Some of you could get a pass and come up anytime. Well this is all I can think of for now. Lorin will be down around that part of the country next week, I suppose.
Write when you can, we're always ticked to hear from home.
Much love to all,
Lovingly,
Grace
Tues. A.M. -
Am sure going to get this mailed this morning. We have a train out of here for St. Louis at 3:37 P.M. and Lorin was just saying at the breakfast table that we could go down and see the Veiled Prophet tonight and get home on the midnight train if Bess could get her Supt.Â to teach for her half hour. So no telling we may be there tonight ourselves. The matter is to be settled at noon after Bess talks with the Supt. and Lorin is to study it over.
Write soon.
Grace</p>

My Dear Ruby:
Just now I heard the honk, honk of an auto in front of the door but just thought it was Lewis. Then I asked Lucerne to look out and see, and it was the Smarts of Milton come down Â to meet May, and May was with him. She said Vinnie had sent her word to come at once as Lisa was so much worse. She asked for you and wanted you to go up with her. I wish you had been here, for it seems that none of us has been of any assistance to them. May then asked if I could jump in and go as you was not here, but of course I couldn't leave just now, and I feed so bad about it too. And Dr. is away in hospital too, and I guess that makes Lisa feel that there is no one to look out for him. I would liked to have heard how Uncle Jim is today. Mr. Johnson was asking me how he was, and said if it hadn't been for Aunt Sarah he wouldn't have been down there. I told him that was the place for him for there were so many of them all there and so good to take care of him. He said if he didn'tÂ change his mind he was going down there next Monday.
We washed today and I am tired out. Didn't get done till after noon. I hope Aunt Sarah is feeling all right. Annie did not say in her letter but I guess if there had been anything the matter with her, she would have mentioned it. I am making corn salad now just started on it about those little onions I wrote you about. I wouldn't get them if they are a big price. 40 per gallon is plenty to pay for them.Â I must stop now.
Love to all,
Mamma</p>

Dearest Net and all,
Just a few to let you know that Grandpa is better this morning. He can't use his left hand at all. Just from his wrist. Grandma is feeling about the same. Her back and side hurts quite a bit. She wants you to send her winter underclothes and Grandpa too. We got a card from Ray on Tuesday and it was mailed at Spokane Washington. Looking for a card today. I had the paper hanger and painter yesterday. Haven't got everything back in place yet. Was up and help Aunt clean up for she has so much to do. Bill sat up until midnight so did Sapp and Gladys. Grandpa's bowels was so loose. Sapp got a bottle of Blackberry Brandy and it is helping him.
I bet Leta is happy. If you see give her my best wishes.
This will be all for today.
Love to all,
Opal</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all,
Received a letter from Papa yesterday and a long on today and was sure glad to get them. Gee they sure are doing some business back there. Think I told you in other letter I'd be here a month longer and possibly two. Glad to hear Ralph is back at work. I don't want to work on era very bad but I'd like awful well to be closer to home. Gee I wish I could see some of you . I sold a ticket to Waterburg Conn last night - $72.40- I didn't have any ticket on hand so I wired Sam Luis Abirro to send me one and gave him the routing and he sent it up all made out. Excursion tickets are on sale the year round. Every Friday and Saturday have reduced rates to nearly all the places along the line. Can get a ticket to Chicago and return for $65.00.
Sure have some powerful engines on this line. They're all oil burners. Haven't a coal burner on the line.
I stuck a first class passenger train 5 minutes yesterday morning account putting "9th" for "September" - They might give me 10 days for it - They're awful strict. They all say that if you can work for the S.P. you can work for any road in the country. They sure enforce their rules. I was in a hurry to make out the clearance as train was ready to leave and without thinking I put 9/20 instead of September 20 - That's OK on any other road but this one. It takes about 3 years to land a job on this road. But if extra work is good I think I'll stick. Of course I'd probably lay off and come home before 3 years. But these are pretty good jobs and I want to land something steady if I can. I don't have to fill lamps or lanterns or sweep out or handle baggage or anything like that. Have a baggage boy to do that. All stations have a baggage boy. All I have to do is sell tickets, copy orders, and put on mail. Sure copy a bunch of orders and seek quite a few tickets.
Well must stop. Hope to hear from you all soon-
I'll write more often
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dearest Net and all,
Just a few lines to tell you Grandpa is awful sick. Had the Dr. to him today. Grandma isn't feeling very well either. The Fall didn't put her in bed but made her feel bad. Grandpa told Bill he didn't think he could last long. The rest of us are all well. So glad you got to go to the fair. Bill is waiting for this to close.
As ever,
Opal</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received Mama's letter yesterday and haven't heard from papa in a coons age. Sure was glad to get Mama's letter. This is first time I've written for several days. Getting along OK and will be on this job at least a month longer and probably 2 months. Agent has gone to New York so regular 3rd trick man got his job leaving me here for while longer. Sure have a bunch of train orders to handle. Keeps me going sometimes. Getting pretty cool out there at night. Have to have a fire every night. See in the paper where they have rented the M.E. Church for Primary room. Thought they had built a new school house there or had added to the old one. See they've started on the ditch again. I'd like to see it.
I've been going up to the school-man's house nearly every night. We all went swimming other day. Gee they have swell schoolhouse here. Have piano, dance floor, opera house, and everything in it. Have some pretty swell scenery on the stage. It's a single story building but has 4 rooms besides the opera and dance room. Sure is swell.
Gee I sure was tickled when agent told me he was going to lay off 2 months. Felt pretty sure I'd get to stay on this job. Ruby is making a pretty good visit at Grace's. Wish I was there.
Well I must stop and get busy. Bell rings just about every 10 or 15 min for 9.00. Wish you'd all write a little more often.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dear Little Hi-Pockets
By Golly you waited an awful long time before you answered my letter. What seems to be the trouble? Anyway I was awful glad to get it. Aren't you glad to get started back to school?
Golly you misspelled lots of words and used a good deal of rough grammar. But seeing that you've been out of school quite a bit I'll excuse you this time. But never again.
Are you and the little Hoover girl still chummy? Golly I wish you were out here with me. Did you and Dick Davis wrestle any? i'll bet he can work on you.
Well old timer. I got a train close so must stop. Now since you are starting to school you will have plenty of paper and pencils and you can write to me every day or so.
Your Great Big Brudder,
Martin</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received Mama's nice long letter today and the "Tribune" and "Times" from Bess and sure glad to get them. It's the first I've received for a week. Haven't heard from Papa for about a week. Generally hear from Papa every 2 or 3 days. Not much news to write. Received letter from Ruth Powers yesterday. She is going to Fairmount College this winter. Surprised to hear Carrie Wild was married. I received 2 or 3 letters from her while in Montana but she didn't say anything about being engaged. Got my pay check yesterday. $49.00. Board was 27 and O.R. 2 $6.00 and paid $5.00 on my suit. Got $3.50 left. I'm going to send for Tribune tonight so can get it every week. It's getting a little colder here all the time. Have to have a fire every night. Think I'll be here until first of September. Bulletin was up on this place yesterday but don't think they will fill it until 1st of month. Sure hope they don't strike cause that would throw us out of a job. I don't think they will strike though. I went to Atascadero yesterday pm with another man and his wife in a car. It's a settlement just sprung up lately. Yet it sure is a pretty place. More like a park than anything else. All kinds flowers. We have lots of fruit of every description here. I'm so tired of it can hardly look at it anymore. Here Knox sure pulled off a heroic stunt when he saved the little girls fishing pole. Ha- wish I could see you all. I was so homesick last night didn't know what to do. I'd just love to see that Illinois river.
Must stop and go to work.

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received letter from Papa yesterday and sure glad to get it. Nothing new to write. Getting along OK. It has been pretty cool here last 2 days. Had to build fire last night and got one going tonight. All the people around here treat me just fine.
Mama I haven't received the pictures yet. Will enclose stamps to send them. Would like to have the Tribune occasionally too. I'm going to to subscribe for it pretty coon. Was intending to go swimming today but it was too cold. Played ball with Santa Margarita last Sunday and guess will play again next Sunday.
I'm feeling pretty bum today. Caught a bad cold but guess I'll be ok in day or two. Well must stop as don't know anything to write. Everybody write soon.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>
