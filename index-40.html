<p>Ahweiler, Germany
April 3, 1919
Dear Lorin, Grace, and Audrey
just few lines tonight while have an opportunity to write. This will be last letter I'll write in Germany. Post office closes in Morning. Haven't received any mail from you all since last writing. Hear from Papa every time mail comes in. Won't get anymore mail on this side of water. Division headquarters leaves here for Brest on the 5th. The Signal Battalion leaves here 3:50 am the 10th. Probably arrive Brest the 13th or 14th and embark about the 16th or 17th. Will be in states by time this letter reaches you. At present I'm billed to be demobilized in Texas. That's because I enlisted there but I'm pretty sure I can have it changed to Camp Taylor, Kentucky because it would cost the government less to send me to Taylor than it would to Texas. The majority of the Signal Battalion will be mustered out in Camp Taylor. I worn have vert far to go from there to see you all. Golly, but I'm certainly tickled we are going.
There will be 23 trains more theDivision to Brest. 24 american box cars to a train and 45 men to a car. They figure on making the trip to Brest in 60 hours. We leave on the 20th train. Had physical examination yesterday. I passed ok but there were quite a few who didnt pass, due to their own misconduct. They were sent to hospital and Lord only knows when they'll get home. I'd certainly hate to be in their shoes.
Having hie weather now but had quite a spell of rotten weather lately.
We'll I'll have to stop. Sure hope I get to come to Taylor to be discharged. Will wire you when I arrive in States but don't be surprised if the telegram comes collect -Ha.
Well hope you are all well. Will see you soon.
Lots Love
Martin</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and All
No mail since last writing. Guess I wont write very many more times from Germany . Division headquarters leaves on first train April 2nd for Brest. Rest of the division will follow and I think we will all be out of here by the 6th. Don't know how long we will lay in Brest but they say we will stay there no longer than is necessary to embark. Oh Lordy but I'll certainly be glad when I get on that ship and know that I'm really on my way home. All men are Classified here and will be sent to different camps in the States to be demobilized. I'm listed to go to Camp Bowie, Texas because I enlisted in El Paso. I tried to get it changed here but couldn't but am going to try as soon as we get to the states. I certainly don't want to go to Texas to be discharged and then have to pay carfare home. The rest of the signal camps, lot rather, those who enlisted at points in Central Miss Valley will be demobilized at Camp Taylor Kentucky. that's where I'd like to gland thats where I'm going to try and get them to send me cause then I could drop in on Lorin and Grace and it wouldn't take me long to get home from there. I rather dread the ride to Brest in Box cars but we'll be "Homeward Bound" so it won't be so bad.
Guess I forgot to enclose that speech the other day cause I found it in my pocket today. Will enclose it together with a letter from Gen. pertaining to our Commanding General.
Understand we get to keep our gas masks and helmet. I'm certainly going to bring mine home. We are going to be paid off before we leave ere but I've only got about 10/000 cummings. Had to pay for suit of underwear out of this pay. I left it somewhere or another and they charged me about 6.00 for it. They sure stick a man when he loses anything. I'll be glad to have the 10 bucks though cause we wont have much to at on the trip to Brest and that will give me a chance to buy cakes etc while going through France. They charge like the dickens in France and I expect I'll hit the states dead broke but I'll be glad to get there under any circumstances.
Everything is in readiness for the divisions departure. The general has already left for Brest. We will be deloused before boarding train at Remagen. Remagen is about 12 miles from here, on the Rhine river. We'll have to hike that distance with our packs. Pack contains 3 blankets, shirt, suit of underwear, bed sack, 3 pair of socks and reserve rations in addition to toilet articles and mess kit. Besides that have to carry rain coat, overcoat, gas mask helmet, canteen, and pistol belt. All told will weight about 100 pounds and you can imagine what it will be to walk 12 miles carrying 100 pounds. Oh well I should worry cause it will be the last time we'll have to hike any distance and so long as we're going home I don't care what we have to do just so we get there.
Just had a long talk with old pal of mine. He called me up from 2nd Division. He's still in the First Field B'n. Said he expects to stay a year. Gee but he's homesick. Says he wishes we was with me. I'm mighty glad I'm not in the regular army now.
Been having some rotten weather past 10 days. Rains or snows every day. Only a short time ago it was nice spring weather. Gee but I'll be glad to get out of this country. The German people hate to see us leave because they've received pretty good treatment at our hands.
Well I must close and go to work. Am on duty tonight at Message Center. Expect the Message Center will be one of the last details to leave here. Hope I'm in the states by time this reaches you. Will wire you when I arrive.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

<p>Dearest Papa, Mama, and all:
Received dandy long letter from Papa yesterday and was sure glad to get it. Have received three letters from Papa since last writing. Has been about a week since I last wrote. Also received dandy letters from Bess and Lorin yesterday. Very glad to get them. Glad every body is well now. Nothing new to write. Everything going about the same in Ahrweiler. It is again rumored that we will leave the latter part of this month but I absolutely refuse to put any faith in rumors any more. The schedule says we will leave the latter part of April. I wont believe we are going home until we are actually on our way. I mailed you a book containing cartoons of the A.E.F. this morning. They were taken from the "Stars and Stripes". They come nearer to showing things as they really were than any I've ever seen. Some of them are sure comical but guess you'd have to be acquainted with the ways of the Army before you could appreciate them. Could only get one. They seemed to be pretty scarce. They cost 5 francs--thats about a dollar. Intend to answer Lorin's letter tonight. He wrote a dandy long letter. Will answer Bess' letter tomorrow. Don't have a great deal of time to write during the day cause we are kept pretty busy but am off every night at 5 pm. Gee--we sure are having lovely weather. Regular spring. Sure makes me want to be home. Lots of our fellows have gone away to school in France and England. Some of them went to Edinburgh, Scotland. They take a four months course in what ever subject they wish. I wouldn't stay over here four months longer for all the universities in the world. Don't suppose I could get in any way.
Have been feeling just fine and dandy. Never felt better in my life. Would like to be doing some out-door work. This is too good weather to stay inside all the time. I've been to the dentist about five times during the past week. Have had two teeth filled (1 upper and 1 lower) and have two more lower teeth to be filled. My teeth haven't bothered me since Dr. Hume did the work on them at White Hall about 8 or ten years ago. The two lowers to be filled now are the ones to be filled with silver. The two lowers to be fled now are the ones he filled with silver. The silver is too prominent and makes my teeth two black so the dentist here is going to take the silver out and fill them with cement. That's only thing they fill teeth with over here. Couldn't hardly expect any thing more though, seeing that it is free of charge.
I sure hate a dentists chair. Will be glad when the work is finished. Lord-I sure wish I was home and out of the army. Bet they don't get me in the army again. I'm so sick and tired of beans and rice that I never want to see them anymore. We did, however, have biscuits for dinner yesterday. Was sure surprised. They certainly tasted good. Haven't had an egg for about 6 or 8 months. They only cost about 15 cents a piece here. Sure are scarce.
Well, will close for this time. Hope you all keep on writing. Don't see how I could get along if it wasn't for the letters I get. Hope this finds you all well. Will write again soon.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received letter from Papa today dated Jan 10th. Doesn't take mail very long to get here now. Certainly was glad to get it. Glad to know Ruby has recovered from the flu. First I had heard of her sickness. Sure is good to know you are all well. I'm still on the same job but expect to attend school at Coblens commencing next Monday. Cobblers is a pretty large city. Not much news about when we will leave but general impression is that we will start about the 1st of March. Certainly hope we do cause I'm mighty anxious to get home. Picked up some Radio press last night. Said 42nd and 32nd divisions would be first complete national guard units home and 77th Division would be first drafted division home. Like to get home and bid in some of there jobs that are on bulletin.
Having a show here nearly every night. Will mail you some of the programs if I can find them. Having a German grand opera tonight but I'm on duty and can't go. However they're having another one tomorrow night so guess I'll go to it. Doesn't cost anything. Have a swell theatre, looks just like the ones in the states.
Forgot to mention that I received letter from Papa other day enclosing copy of Mr. Doocy's letter. Glad you mailed them a copy of my letter. If I'm ever in Pittsfield I'll call on them.
Found out about my allotment today. it's still infect and will continue until I get out of the army.
Hope you're getting it regularly. I've been feeling just fine. Feel like I want to get out and run all the time. Have a great big feather bed to sleep in. Get lots of sleep, plenty to eat and not much work. I'll be all ready to go to work after I see you all and visit Ruby and Grace.
Think we get one months extra pay when we're discharged. That will by me a suit of clothes. It wont take me long to make enough to fit myself out with plenty of clothing. Certainly would like to get into a suit of civilian clothes again.
Rumor has it that when we leave here we sail on the Rhine up to Belgium. Sounds plausible.
Division is ranting 14 day leaves now to men who wish to visit relatives in Scotland, Ireland, England, or Italy. Guess that doesn't include me case if I have any relatives in any of those countries I don't know it. Besides I haven't the funds to provide for such a trip. Wouldn't mind going to Italy. They say Rome is a wonderful place. I'll be satisfied if they'll just send me home though. Don't think I'll ever cross the Atlantic again, once I get on the other side. Hows Knox making it? Certainly was tickled to hear about Audrey talking in her sleep and saying "God Bless her little heart." Ha ha.
I certainly did get the Christmas box and I want to say that I enjoyed it ever so much. I've a lot of back mail coming yet if it ever gets here.
Be glad when the Conference gets a peace treaty ready for Germany to sing. Hope they get things settled in Russia. See where our troops are fighting there.</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received three letters from Papa, one from Ruby and one from Grace and Lorin today, all back mail but I was certainly glad to get it. Don't see why you all aren't getting any mail from me. I've written regularly past two months. Ruby wrote a dandy long letter. Glad to hear Sam was promoted. Hope he is out of Army by now. Sure wish I was out. haven't heard anything new about coming home. I'll certainly be glad to get back into civilian clothes again. I'll have some pictures taken while I'm in uniform before I come back and mail them to you. Was up to Cologne yesterday. Sure is some city. I had a pass to sports meting between 2nd Canadian and 42nd American divisions. We won nearly everything. Am sending you few views of Ahrweiler and Cologne. The church you see is certainly some church, I was through it. Certainly beautiful. Think its the 2nd largest in the world.
I'm still working at message center. Keep pretty bus during day. Am feeling fine and dandy. Hope mama and Anna are well. Certainly hated to hear they had the influenza.
Having good warm weather - that is - warm for this time of year.
Glad to hear, L.E. has a good job with Swift and Co. I'm anxious to get back to telegraphing. They're paying so much more than when I left. Hope papa gets ride of the agency there. That's too much of a roast.
Glad Grace and Lorin visited home. Must be rather lonesome around there with all the girls gone.
Say - are you still getting the allotment?</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Received two letters from Papa day before yesterday dated Dec 12 and 18th both saying Mama and Anna were sick with influenza. Sure hated to hear it. Hope they are well by now. Don't think much of that influenza.
Not much news to write. Every thing about the same as I wrote in my last letter. Am 23 years old today. Getting to be an old man -Ha. One year ago today I was in hospital at Havre, France with measles. Sure am anxious to get home. Nothing new about leaving here.
We have a YMCA and Red Cross here. Red Cross serves hot chocolate and cake every day and generally have an entertainment every night. Going to have a dance tonight from 7 pm to 9 pm. Bunch of American girls coming up from Coblenz.
Still having good weather. Suppose it is pretty cold around there now. Would like to take in some of the skating there. Guess I'll be there next winter.
Notice by Papa's letter that the girls at Wichita didn't come home for Christmas. Must have been pretty lonesome at home with everybody gone.
Well must stop and get busy. Only had time for a few lines. Hope Mama and Anna are up and around before now. Will write again soon.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Mailed From: Milton, Ill. on January 7, 1919
<p>Milton, Jan 7 - 1919
My dear Aunt Nettie and all-
I was surprised and tickled to get your letter today - to show you I was glad, I'm going to answer tonight. I never heard one work about any of you having flu - I may as well be 1000 miles away from you for I never get to see any of you and seldom see anyone from Pearl and Grace is in NY - another shack - I never dreamed she was so far away.  I ordered some Libby Jam and preserves through our grocer last week. We used to get it in Wichita and it was lovely - Yes it does seem so strange to think of Ruby being a Mother - and I've never got used to Grace being one yet.  I thought surely I'd write to Ruby before now, but when I write to Mae I know they all hear from me or us and I wrote her one big long letter last and the old girl never did answer but Mae said the girls knew when she wrote to me she told all about her and so we were all posted on each others doing better than we are who are only a few miles apart. We have had so much flu around Milton but very little in town. Dr. has treated 200 cases, I have been so worried for fear he'd get it but I never saw him look so well in all my life - he is hungry every mine. He is so strong and well and I never saw him so happy. But he has been on the job day and night. Really for about two weeks I didn't get one thing gone but wait on callers, answer phones and fix meals at any and all hours for him. Three nights in succession he was only in bed about four hours. It was a bad time for every body. I am so afraid you got up too soon after having it. I think it is terribly treacherous and I've been scared to death of it. I've been ready to take my bed about a dozen times, hinting I had it. Dr would take my temperature and maybe it would be below normal but I'd be sure I had fever but couldn't scare it up. Folks have had lots of fun  over me being so afraid of it and Frank has told such terrible things I've done and of course  - made it so much bigger than it was - but I'll admit I was scared half to death of it and am yet. I have enough without it - but I'm so well now. I weigh 140 - Most I've weighed for many days - I'm thinking very seriously of going to Wichita in Feb. I think if I can stay up this winter I'd be feeling fine in the spring. Tell Annie Grover's address is Cleo, OK. That was killing about the letter and she sure took good care of herself when she had the flu too. Didn't leave you with a  cough? It was a wonder it hadn't hurt Ruby badly as it goes so hard with young mothers usually. I'll bet little old Knox was glad to see his Mama come in to Pearl. Uncle Lige phoneme about the boy and he was so tickled he could hardly tell it. He also told me you had gone, and I was so glad for Ruby and you too. You don't have any idea when Martin will be coming home? I had such a lovely visit with Mrs. Dadey last month at Pitts. and she said she had no thought that her boy would not come back. This war has cost many terrible heartaches but with them has come a lasting good, and we will see it in many ways. But it was an awful price to pay - Virginia is still in Jacksonville. She was home for eight weeks. She was quarantined all the time before Xmas and now the old flu has started in the school again. It is discouraging for the kids to have to be shot in so much. I shall send you a Democrat and I know how much Judge and Mrs. Dadey appreciated you sending them the letter from Martin. We will be so glad to see the dear old boy again. It will be so wonderful to year him tell of what he has gone through. It seems to me he could have anything I have, and I could never do enough for him to pay him for what he has been doing to save us from the very thing he has gone through. I feel like we can never do enough for our boys who have been in action. I get so worked up over it that I think I'll drop the subject. Lucerne and Margaret haven't been bad. Not sick at all Mae tell me. I think that is just splendid too. and it is a wonderful opportunity for the girls. I sure want Knox to come up next summer. How is he on gardening? but I expect you'd need him at garden making time ourself but he is fine at riding in Autas, so I expect thats what we'll do naif we get last he'll be along to tell us what direction we're going. Ask him how he'd like that. He's a dandy fellow any way. And we had a fine visit with Annie too. Tell Annie we have a new preacher. She heard him while he was here on trial. Rev Bass from Sweetwater! Quite a fisky name isn't it? I believe we are going to like him real well. O.P. Balman, Annie's good friend, sent him to us. He fed $12.00 and personage. We were all out t Al's last night to the old Hess home to a big house warming. It was swarming with people tell. Tell Bertha not to forget we are to meet here same day and stay all night with All and Blauche. It is a grand home - electric lights furnace and water system. Surely made me wish for a bigger house.
Must quite now. Give my love to each and all-
Lovingly,
Vinnie
I was so glad to get your letter. Write again.</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all,
Received letter from Papa yesterday and I'll say right now that I was mighty glad to get it. First mail I have received since 1st of Oct. Great to know everybody is well. Didn't know Mama was in Wichita. Sure glad to hear Ruby and child were doing well. How much does he weigh? Gee! I'm an Uncle twice now and haven't seen either one of my new relations yet but hope to before very long. We're all full of hope that we will be home by February 11th. Having very mild weather over here. Have a dandy place to stay. Nice warm fire and plenty of straw for a bed.
Just read in "Stars and Stripes" the concluding installment of the work done by A.E.F. since being in France. Written by General Pershing to Sec'y Baker. The first installment was in "Stars and Stripes" last week. It is very interesting. He doesn't give the 42nd much praise but they certainly deserve as much as any Division and more than some of the Divisions. Suppose it will be published in the Hate's so you'll have a chance to read it.
Hope the telegraphers get the raise they're after. Relay jobs and W.U. jobs should pay pretty good. Don't think I'll waste much time in going to work when I return. Haven't done much today. Just lounged around our billet. Had beef potatoes and tomatoes for dinner. Rice pudding for dessert.
I signed pay roll for 3 months pay other day. Have $120.60 coming minus 86.00 for allotments and insurance. I dont know how my allotment stands and wont find out until my service record gets back. Hope it is still going home. I made allotment 1st of Sept. 1917 good for one year. In July 1918 we had another form to sign account could only make $15.00 through government and any additional amount was to be made through Quartermaster. Don't know whether I told you of this before or not. I made $15 through QM in July 18 but don't know for how long its effective. If it was annulled 1st of September I'll get the allotment they have been charging me with, on a later pay.
We have a pretty fair shower bath here for which we are all thankful. It's a mighty hard job to keep rid of the cooties-Ha.
Well I must close. Hope I get my back mail real soon. Will write again in few days.
Lovingly,
Martin

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Well I finally got back to my organization and consider myself extremely fortunate in getting back. Left town Christmas, hiked part of day and rode in a box car for next two days. There were 32 of us in a  car. A french box car is about half as large as ours. We were packed in like sardines. Hardly had room to sit down. Had salmon and hard tack for Christmas dinner. Expected to get my mail upon arrival here but it was all forwarded to Central post office. So guess I'll have to wait couple weeks more before getting my mail. Just my luck. Well anyway I'll get my mail regularly from now on. It's not like being in a confounded casual camp.
Germany seems a much nicer country than France. Everything is more up to date. The people all treat us very cordially but of course its for their interest to do so cause they're depending on Uncle Sam for food.
Our chief signal officer, colonel Garrett predicts that we will be in the states by middle of February. Certainly hope his prediction is correct.
Expect to go to work on Radio  job tomorrow. Have been busy last two days putting up the radio set. Have an "E-10" set. It's for both undamped and damped wave. It is only for reception. Want to get the various official "Communiques."
Our Divisional Radio set copies England, Russia, United States, and all the nearby countries. IT was made by Sergeant in "A" company. Entirely homemade.
I've had no experience whatever with an undamped wave set, my experience being confined totally to the type "A" French (Damped Wave) set - but all I have to do is receive and I know I can put down anything they send.
Having very mild weather here for this time of year. Much more pleasant than in France. Also have better places to sleep. In France we generally had a cold barn, while here we have a regular place and the German's furnish light, heat, and straw for our beds.
We have 5 hours drill each day but I wont have to do that on account being assigned to special duty.
Expect to get some mail from you all during interval of two weeks. I'm waiting for my back mail. Hope so anyway - Haven't had any mail since 1st of October. Received pay for month of September when I arrived here. They had held it. I had signed pay roll for September before leaving for hospital but wasn't paid so received it when I returned. Will get pay for October, November, and December on next pay role - that is - if they put me on pay roll. My service record was also sent away but think they have enough dope here to put me on pay role.
I don't know how my allotment stands. Made allotment Sept 1st, 1917 effective for one year and in July 1918 they brought out new form to sign. Couldn't make but $15.00 allotments through government and  any additional amount was to be made through the Quarter Master. I made $15.00 through government and $5.00 through Q.M. in July but don't know for how long it is effective. Will find out when my service record gets back. I'm being paid at same old rate so guess the allotment is still good.
Well must close for this time. Write you all again soon as I hear from you. Am feeling fine and dandy. Have gained few pounds during past month. Hope this finds you all well.
Lovingly,
martin

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Good chance to write few lines this pm so thought I'd do it. Nothing new to speak of. Understand we will leave here tomorrow or next day but don't know where we're going. Wish we were homeward bound. Just one year ago today (3 pm) we were clearing the docks at New York on the Steamship, Lapland. It was an English passenger liner but carried troops during the war. I had a dandy room during the voyage. Landed in Liverpool Jan 7th and went to Winchester, England. Was there for 5 days. I contracted the measles there and went to the hospital upon arrival at Le Havre. That's last I saw of the 1st F.B.S.C. Now I don't know whether or not I'll ever see the 117th F.B.S.C. anymore or not. Golly I'd certainly love to have my mail and know how you all are.
I wrote the girls at Wichita on the 21st and Grace the 22nd. Today is pretty day. First clear day we've had for several weeks. I was up yesterday over the ground which we captured during the St. Michael drive. It's only a short distance from here. 10 miles. Went to the place where we kicked off at 5 am the morning we drove. It has been cleared up since the battle. Shell holes had been filled up and debris cleared away. Saw the graves of some of my friends. There were six of us made the trip. Two of them had been wounded during that battle and went to the exact spot where they had been hit. Got back here last night in time for supper. Sure was tired. It was during that drive that Elmer Dooey was killed. Didn't knew he was from Pittsfield until I saw his name in Casualty list.
Well don't know any more to write. Hope I'm home for next Christmas.
Will write again soon as I find out where we're going.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>
