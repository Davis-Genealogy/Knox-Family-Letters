<p>From: Ethyl Ransom, To: Ruby Chandler</p>
<p>Dear Ruby,
Am going to write you a few lines only. Just want to tell you that I am feeling dandy though the weather is pretty hot. Have been working hard but am all through with my sewing. The big event comes off on Tuesday. Only two more days from this. Seems funny! I was in Wichita Thursday. Saw Allan Jones and he told me that you left on Monday the 8th. He said you were one of the prettiest girls he knew. What you think of that? Now Ruby you write to me at Oxford for will be there in a few days. Are you coming back in the fall? Did you take the exam? Give my love to Bess and likewise to Martin. I sure do like that brother of yours. I am sorry I did not meet Grace but I may some time. Did you know Miss M went to Colorado to school? Write soon.
Lovingly,
Ethyl Ransom (yet)</p>

<p>Sunday
Dearest Papa, Mama, and all,
Sure do thank you for then five. Came in handy but I want you to know I earned the money to pay for my Xmas presents. Got $22 for my first case of nursing. No I didn't either, Mae gave me $10.00 for staying with her. I didn't want to take that but she just insisted and as I was altogether broke it looked awfully good. Then at Temps I stayed one week and 3 days for $22. Didn't have anything to do but take care of the little girl. They treated me fine and invited me to stay over Xmas with them and eat turkey dinner but I wanted to eat with the girls. When I left the little girl I was nursing gave me an Xmas present. The sweetest little apron with tattling all around the the pieces set together with tatting wasn't that nice? I have another place now out on College Hill. Three people down and I'll get $30.00 a week here. I gave M &amp; L $5.00 between them after Xmas. Lucerne is going to get her a pair of shoes. Margaret got hers and I got mine. They are awfully good looking.
Our Xmas we sent home looked kind of slim didn't it? I just had one day to shop and I had to wait until I made some money to shop with. I was picking out Xmas cards and found one like the one we sent home. I thought it had lots of good thoughts and it also there was a lot of loving thoughts with out gifts. Grace sent me a pair of silk stockings and Mae gave me a pair too. Mrs. D.D. gave each M, L, and I a drop de china handkerchief. They surely treated Ruby and Sam as well as the rest of us lovely- R &amp; S were going to eat Xmas dinner over there and us girls over to Mae's but we changed plans and we all ate over to Mary's and such a dinner. We had a regular one - I'll let Ruby tell you what she got. Ruby was awfully blue because Sam had to go back.
Margaret has the flu and so far as I can hear is getting along fine. I have to hear thru Mae - She sent her thermometer down by Art. Mae said she would have taken care of Margaret rather than to have her down home at 215 E Dewey but she wasn't strong yet herself. If Ruby and Lucerne need me I'm willing and ready to go but I thought $30.00 isn't picked up every week.
Do you hear anything from Martin? Bet he;s anxious to get home. Sure was glad to hear you were all better at home. Ruby, M, and L gave me a flowered petticoat and some handkerchiefs. Think I've told you everything Old Santa brought me now. I made Art and the boys a plate of homemade candy and have Mae a pair of Manicure scissors. When did the things arrive home? The girls hadn't done any shopping to speak of and M and I did most of it Xmas Eve day. The day I went home from Temps.
The baby is getting along fine and Ruby looks well.
Hope to hear from you soon
Love,
Bess</p>

Wiggins</p>
<p>Dearest Aunt Millie,
I have been away from home over a month as Harold had his vacation and we spent most of the time at his home in Catarissa Penna. We drove thru and even though it was twelve hundred miles it seemed like no trip at all. Your card was forwarded to me and as always I was glad to hear from you. I had hoped to get an apt. here but we have a vacancy in one of the apts. at some and besides mother is not at all well so tomorrow Harold is taking me to Topeka and at Xmas he will come to be with us. If at all possible I shall return here at that time with him. It is very difficult for me to leave mother at all and we can not always arrange to have her with us as it is not possible for her to have her comforts any place like at "Home Sweet Home." I do hope darling you are well and have things comfortable. To be in a warm home is a lot to be thankful for, so many poor people suffer in cold weather. Speaking of weather, ever have we had such a fall even now winter has not arrived and its nearing Xmas. My little dog is sitting on the window sill looking down on the street, guess she thinks she is directing traffic as she growls when ever a dog passes or anything else she doesn't like the looks of. Aunt Millie have you tried during the past few years to get glasses? Maybe you need new ones. It's a shame for you not to have them if you could see better.
Poor mother nothing helps her any, neither the operation nor glasses and it make me very sad. She still sees enough to get around the house and neighborhood but that is about all. I miss her and her interesting letters. I am trying to write larger so you can read my letter more easily. Do you ever hear from Lela? After all the money you spent on the child its pitiful that she isn't with you when you do need her so badly. I wish it was so I could see you at least occasionally but I can scarcely leave mother to even be with my very good husband.
I received a letter from Bertie yesterday. He keeps well but so busy he hardly has time to go see mother. His two younger daughters are away to school. One in Chicago and the other in Lawrence, Ks. He sees them both often as he has to make frequent trips to Chicago.
I shall close now dearest Auntie and take my little dog out for a stroll. Again I shall say that I hope my letter finds you well and happy. Am glad you have so many good friends.
Love and a kiss,
Your devoted niece,
Betty Ann Tilley
