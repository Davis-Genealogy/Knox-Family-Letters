Dear Lize,
Your most welcome letter received and contents perused with pleasure. I suppose you will not find this letter very interesting and am at a lose to know or think of anything to write at a lll. So if you find it very dry, please excuse for this time and perhaps I can do better next time. I have been doing lots of running around the past two or three days. Last Monday I spent the day with Miss Mary Hicks and yesterday I was working on fancy work all day at the milliner shop and today will go again. So you see I am making up for when I had to stay at home. Monday while I was at Miss Hick's the Dr. came up to see how I was getting along and low and behold I was visiting. I guess he thought I was a rather pert patient. Don't you think so too? yes, I guess Willie is pretty tired of Pearl by this time but Pa said in one of his letters to me that he was going to try to get Willie to stay the balance of the winter there at home. But I fear he will not succeed for I think Willie would nearly die to stay there and have nothing to do. That was too bad about that poor man that had his legs cut off and I think it was a good thing that death did claim him as he always would have been such a bad cripple. Do you know what his name is? This is a lovely day and so pleasant. There is a splendid sleighing snow on the ground and the sleigh just more than fly. Where does Scrooge work about? I suppose Joe thinks he is competent to be Opr. Agent and all in one. Will he get a job and if so, where? I think the different R.R. Co's were very good to remember you so kindly by sending you such presents as you named in you letter. Well I would like to have seen Lizzie and Maggie when their sleigh broke down. I know I would have laughed. Has Pa got a sleigh or who's do they use. Well I must now close and go up town to my work. Good-bye with my love to you.
I am ever yours,
Nettie
(I would like to talk to you 2 or 3 days_
Write Soon.</p>

Dear Lige,
Your most welcome letter received yesterday and contents read with pleasure as it had been a long time it seemed to me since I had heard from you.
It took my letter of the 1st longer time to reach you than usual. I wrote you another before that one dated December 29th I believe. It surely did not reach you as you said you had been looking for a letter from me for 2 or 3 days. and I did not get any answer to it. I need your telegram today about 1/2 past 3 o'clock. I am sorry you were so uneasy about me but I appreciate your kindness to me more  than I can express. I did not answer your telegram as I am sure Maggie received a letter from me today and it will say how I am and knowing they would let you know I thought it no use to answer the telegram as the letter will be there sooner than it anyway. I am now about all right with the exception of a very  severe cold. My eyes are now all right except  a little weak yet. My face is clear of the breaking - out, but there is some signs of it still on my hands. I have not been, to say, sick at all only while my eyes were so very sore I kept to my bed most of 2 or 3 days. I have not been out of doors this past week but I expect to go up town tomorrow if the day is not stormy. I was so frightened when the Express Agent brought me the telegram today I could scarcely open it. I thought so of you were very sick and perhaps it was calling me home. Oh! how glad I would be to be there. I would give anything to see you but now it is a little over 2 months to wait until that time comes. I am so glad to have your picture when I get to thinking of you I can get your pictures and look at it, if I can't see you personally. I look at it 5 or 6 times a day. I see you still have that pin with "N"  on it. It looms up in the picture. Every time I show it to anyone here they notice the pin and ask me if it is mine. I tell them it used to be. Johnnie and some more of the town boys have been sawing ice. They are not done yet. I tell you we have to get up a little earlier while he is at work. But today being Sunday we did not have to get up so early. While we were at our breakfast, Johnnie said we were eating our dinner and I asked him why he said that. He said it was just twelve o'clock (noon) and I did not believe it and left the table to look at the clock, and sure enough it was 12-5. Wasn't we early? Do you ever get up so early?
Oh! Oh! Mister! You think you would treat me the same as the other girls if I was there. Do you? Well now I guess you wouldn't, I have something to say about that. I could not help but laugh when I read in your letter about you falling on the platform. It would have been a picnic for Lizzie and Maggie if they had seen you about that time. I am sorry to hear of Willie's misfortune but I had heard of it before. I suppose he will never find his pocket book not hear anything of it again. Oh! Yes - I suppose Frank Williams has Frank Woods done up. It would not surprise me very much if William and Lizzie marry. Pa said in one of his letters that they was afraid Williams would cause them to offer up another girl before the winter is over.
What do you think about it? Say tell Lizzie J. For me that I am just as Mad as I can be at her because she has not answered my letter.
I would like to have seen the show you told me about (The Man and Bear) I think I should have enjoyed it ever so much. Oh! I do hope they will succeed in getting the money to build the church with. That would be so nice. I can hardly write as I am using my knee for a writing desk. You will please excuse writing and lead pencil. Now I will close as it is bedtime. Oh! I forgot to tell you that I got my hair combed New Year's day but I expect if you have been here you could have did a better job of it. I did not style up one but today if it is true. I am getting old fast but I am yours,
Nettie</p>

Dear Nettie,
Your kind letter of 25th received today. I was surely glad to hear from you. Oh yes I got the cup yesterday. Everything in good order I think it is awfully nice and is a very suitable gift. I haven't used it now yet. Maggie was awful anxious to see what was in the box for her. I opened it then went over to the house to tease Maggie. I told her I got the cup but there was nothing for her.
Willie K arrived last night from St. Louis. He thinks he will remain in Pearl awhile. There is king to be a concert Friday night at the church house. Oh yes I got a Christmas card from Miss N. of Jacksonville but I knew it by the handwrite on envelope. There is a good snow on the ground. If you were here I would like to go sleigh riding. I haven't had a ride this winter. Willie was asking me about Miss Emma. I expect he will be out sleigh riding pretty soon. I think they are going to have a big time at Duke's Saturday night.
I am having a good time this week not much work to do, but I expect to pay for it after the holidays are over. I guess you have a good time buying Christmas presents for the children. We'll I hope you may have  a good time new year, there aint nothing going on in Pearl today and nothing to write about. I believe you can beat me writing good long letters. Well I will have to close for this time. Hoping to hear from you soon.
I am your truly,
E.H. Chandler
P.S. I heard from Phillips today. Jr was talking to him on the well. He is working nights at Edwardsville junction for another road.
Lovingly Yours,
E.</p>

Dear Lige: -
You're most welcome letter received yesterday eve late. I was very glad to hear from you again and to heat of you all begin well as this leaves us all at present. Oh! I know you all had a better time there, Christmas than I did here, I think the tree must have looked awful pretty and I only wish I could have gazed upon it. Oh! I am so tired of staying here and last night after I had retired I was thinking of home and nearly made up my mind that I would write you today to say that I would start for home soon and you could write and tell me where you would meet me, but this morn I thought I would stay a while longer anyway. I would hate to leave Johnnie, and especially as he has not found anything to do, he would be so home-sick if I would go home and Willie gone to. I don't know when Johnnie does intend to go home. I have not heard him say anything about it only to wish he was there. I think Maggie's got an awful nice present, also Ma, from the tree. Yours is quite nice also. Who was so thoughtful as to put those on for you? Do you know, I received another present since I wrote you your last. Mr. Hill sent me a large breast pin and a note asking me to accept of it with his best wishes. It is real pretty I think.
I hope you and Maggie has received your presents before this and I hope your cup or saucer was not broken when it reached you. Lige please excuse this short and poorly written letter as I will have to hurry to get it in the Riverton mail now and I am going to call at the doctor's office to have him to do some thing for my face and hands. There is some kind breakout on them and I sure am uneasy about it. Hoping to hear from you soon.</p>
<p>I am yours,
Nettie
Excuse paper as it is all I have at the house, my ink is frozen too.</p>

Dear Nettie,
I will try and answer your kids letter that I received yesterday. I was truly glad to hear from you as I am always thinking what day I will get a letter from you but this time I am afraid it will be a good while for I have not answered the other letter I received 3 or 4 days ago. I will ask you to excuse me this time and I'll promise not to do so anymore. I have been so busy I did not have time to write. The river has froze over and all the freight comes by rail. I had 15 thousand pounds freight to take care of yesterday and had the crew of the Mattie Bell here. They all went to St. Louis. Just fourteen number. There are lots of trains running and I am trying to get out my reports now. So you can see that I have been usually busy. Yes I am sure you will enjoy yourself while Johny is there till I hope he will find a good situation for the winter. Yes I think most any thing will beat railroading. We had an election on the 1st of this month. Sam McKee Flatan and Will Clauinger Flatan. Got 9 Votes. McKee 47 and Clauinger 48. I do not know where George Steelewell lives. His wife is at home but George has skipped out. I suppose you have heard of his trouble have you not. Every body is having a good time in Pearl. Frank Wood is in town I think. Lizzie J is having a good time. There hasn't been anything new in Pearl since I wrote to you last. If you was here I could tell you lots but I can't write it. Haven't been at church for a week. There is church, a green pond tonight if you was here we would just got flying as there is a good snow on the ground. I can not write a very long letter this time but the next time I will not be so busy then I will write you a long letter if can think of enough to write.
Winslow and get a long bass. He is awful good to help. Now Nettie I must close. Have a hard days work before me hoping to hear from you soon.
I Remain Yours Truly
E.H. Chandler</p>

My Dear Friend,
I will now attempt to answer your most esteemed letter which I received Saturday morning. I was very glad to hear from you and that you were thinking of returning to Iowa, and also to hear of your brother. The Riverton young people miss him so much and now they are very lonesome without Miss L. Ellis and mr. Talbott to liven up the parties for they made everything lively when they were about. I am all alone today. Mamma went to Hamburg yesterday and today she has gone over to Mrs. Thompson after some plums and I stayed home to cook dinner for some men that were working here. Brother Joe and Mr. Wes Cowlas came down from Sidney today and they said everybody were well there. Miss Nettie - Among the first you go to visit must be myself. That is, if I do not go off to school before you come.
When you come I will have a party while you are here and have the Sidney and Riverton young folks come and those you know at hamburg. You may bet we will have a fly time while you are with one.
I ask your pardon for not answering sooner for Sunday. I had company all day and yesterday I was making a dress.
Misses Katie and Crissie Thompson started for Lexington, Mo. to attend school and Miss Jennie began to teach school yesterday and they feel very lonesome without thereon during the evening. Jennie teaches in the Riverton school.
It is getting very late and I will have to close with my very best regards to you and all the family.
I remain
Your True Friend
Linnie S.</p>

Dearest Nettie,
Your kind letter of 11th received, will answer this morning. I received your letter the next day after you wrote it but thought I would wait til Sunday to answer. It's getting so cold can't write after night very well. I was at Church last night. This will be the last night if they don't get any converts. Two weeks last night since they commenced they have got one to join the church and two more. I guess you loam up in grand style with that new coat. Better kook our or you might out grow it. Then you would have to buy another one but you could come to Pearl and get small again. I don't know how I am weighing now aint had any scales all winter. Have to guess at everything I ship. Sink &amp; Shea got back from their 2nd trip to Pittsfield last night. I do not know how they made it but they were under 15 hundred dollars last account. Your Pa got home Friday night. Don't think Shea done any thing with the report I told you about in my last letter. The Sheriff came to Pearl last night after eve. I don't know who he was after. He stayed all night at your house. Millie Rose is in Pearl again. HS mad a mash at the night Opr. Mr. Wheeling is here with a  lot of old goods selling at Auction for man by name of Ladow.
Pusby Stephouson has made a solid match on the Milliner's Miss Hormidy. Alex Stephouson has took John Myriser's place selling fruit trees. Belly Maynard is working on the bridge. Him this girl has played out again. Lizzie Frazier is up at Mr. Hess' yet. This is about all that I know to write this time. Am having a very good time going to Church but don't get away from depot til dark every night. I wish you was at home then. I think I would have a good time. I know I would. Do you have any idea what month you will come home in. Write soon. Regards to all
Yours Truly

Dear Lige,
Your letter dated 9th received today. I wrote you this morning and took my letter up town to mail it and where the PM handed me my mail. There was a letter from you and I was most truly glad to get it. Was sorry to hear that you was feeling badly but hope you are all right ere this. How about that bridge falling down. Was it the bridge across the river that you had reference too. If so was there anyone hurt. Oh dear! I do think that Bill Shea is the meanest man that ever stepped. Mattie ought to be very proud of her nice husband. I hope Shea and Sink will both get that they deserve and I hope this will bust them as high as a kite. I think that is a nice report and get out about Bull Shea playing poker in our house for money. I know it is not time but it is time he with some of the other boarders played cards but only for fun. I do not know anything about Pa selling whisky on Sundays. I cannot say that it is not so nor I will not say that it is so but I do hope and trust that he has not stooped so low as that. If he has, it was for that Old Schestein but I would hate to think of it being time. I do wish some one would just beat Shae into a jelly as he deserves when he does as he did to Martin Whalin.
Annie and children has retired  good while ago but I thought I would stay up and write you a little in answer to this letter. Of course I have not much to write now as I wrote all I could think of this morning but I thought I would write a line or two to let you know I received your letter and I knew if I went off tomorrow that I could not write then so I would stay up a while tonight. I have written a long letter to Maggie tonight also.
Oh Lige I would like so well to see you but wouldn't I talk. Why I would talk so much my tongue would be sure but Say- you don't want to be writing me the way you have been tipping your hat at other girls for I am awful jealous. Did you know it? I was awful jealous of Annie and you because of the flirtation you two kept up all the time we were there. Ha! Ha! I'll tell Annie about this tomorrow. Every time any one comes and asks me if I am getting homesick because I can answer Lucy does for me. She always says "Yes- she is homesick to see her fellow - Lige Chandler. He said he was going to keep me but I was not big enough to stay." That is the answer she makes to any body.
Well I did not think I could near fill up this sheet of paper when I commenced to write but I have did so and have no said anything much for foolishness. Write soon.
Yours,
Nettie</p>

Dear Nettie,
I just received your kind letter of 6th. Just was glad to hear from you and to know you are well. I have not been well today but I feel better this eve than I did this fair morn. Haven't had much work to do today as there is only a few trains running on account of a bridge falling down last night. We are having great times now. Everybody is at court but a few lucky ones. S. O'Shea was taken today. I think this trip will about do them up as there are several indictments on all of them. I understand Shea has made a complaint against your Pa for selling whiskey on Sundays. He says also that he had played for many at Mr. Knox's. He thinks your Pa is the cause of him and Turk being pulled as Mr. Knox is on the grand jury. But he can't do anything with your Pa. It's all spite work. I just told you so you would know more about what kind of a man Shea was. They gave Martin Whalun a summons to serve on George Ottwell last night when he went in to Surk's saloon where Ottwell was. Shea knocked him down and let Ottwell get away. I don't know what they will do with Shea if he keeps on this way. They got Ottwell today. Everybody thinks this trip will about break Surk and Shea up.
I would have old you Nettie about Johnny but I didn't want you to be grieving about it when I knew it could do not good. I am sorry that its so. I think the meeting will close tonight. I think they are getting discouraged. Lizzie F. is up at Mr. Hess' again. Said Hess and Mrs. Hess was down to Pearl yesterday but Lizzie stayed to keep house while they were gone. Johnny K and Charley Ottwell went over the river last night to keep out of the way of the Sheriff.
My hat just lands up in grand style with new work in it. Sunday every time I went where Maggie and Lizzie was I tip my hat at them. Lizzie said I thought I was awful smart.
Very truly yours,
EHC</p>
