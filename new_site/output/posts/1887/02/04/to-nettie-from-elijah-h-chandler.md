Dear Nettie

Your warm, kind letter of love, just received and read with great pleasure. Will now try and answer too. Has been a long time since I heard from you but I hope to see you soon then that will pay for waiting. Mrs. Attwell died last night, funeral service tomorrow at the church house. They have sent for Brother Authey to lead the funeral and have not got any answer yet. I don't know whether he will agree or not. I got a letter from Mr. Weedles today. He said if I thought Jae could do the work I might send him to Sinclair next Tuesday morning. Now I am going to let him try it. If he works a failure I can't help it. Sinclair is a small place and not hardly any thing to do so if he can't get along there he can't anywhere else. Yes Jae and Will Maymard are going with the Well's girls and I think they are both pretty boldly gave. I am all right today. I had the tooth taken out before I received your advice about it. I went to Sailor's Lament  last night at the church house. it was very good. Yes I think you had better write when you will reach Whitehall as a letter might be delayed. The Crusher is not working this week they have a breakdown. There will be a good change for a sleigh ride yet this winter. Although there aint any snow on the ground here but it looks like snowing. Now I have told you all. I love to write to you but hope I won't have to write any other time. Write please, see you soon.

Yours truly,

E.H. Chandler</body></html>
