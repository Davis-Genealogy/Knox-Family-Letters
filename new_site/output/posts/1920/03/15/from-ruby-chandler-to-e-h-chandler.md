Monday A.M.

Dearest Folk,

Rather slow acknowledging receipt of the little suit. Thanks so much-came when I needed it most. It fit to perfection-as if you'd had him there. He looks so sweet in it. Jean is a good little boy and so bright. In fact, we all idolize him. It is so very long till you'll be coming and I'm so anxious for you to come. Hope this finds you all well. Vinnie leaves here Wednesday I think. Sam left this A.M.

Lovingly,

Ruby
