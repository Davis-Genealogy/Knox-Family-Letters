Dearest Papa, Mama, and all,

Received latter from Papa yesterday and was mighty glad to get it. Pretty near every mail brings in a letter from Papa. Well, theres new dope out now that we wont leave for some time. They got orders not to turn over equipment until further notice. Darn it! Seems like something comes up every time to change things. Will enclose the speech delivered us by Gen. Pershing up on Rhine last Sunday. Sure was a dandy review.Â Everything went lovely.

Been having some rain and snow lately but today is pretty day.

Heard rumor that we will go through France and not up the Rhine. Certainly hope it isn't true. Sure would hate to go through France. probably have to lay in France for couple of weeks if we go through there.

We don't belong to the 4th Army Corps any more. Are now 3rd Army reserve. Certainly hope we start for home soon cause I'm mighty anxious to get there. I'll be sure and fill out the blank you received from Pittsfield. Are they just for men from Pike County?

Well, haven't much time to write this and don't know much more to write. So will close. Hope you are all well

Lovingly,

Martin</body></html>
