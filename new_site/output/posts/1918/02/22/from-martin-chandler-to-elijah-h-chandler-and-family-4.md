Dearest Folks:

Thought I'd write a few lines tonight before going to bed. Have heard nothing yet as to when I may be able to join my company. Am anxious to get back o them so can get my mail which I'm sure must be with my Company. Last mail I received was a week before leaving the States. Also like to get my pay and my clothes. We're having great weather just like spring. Only hope it continues. This certainly is a very pretty country. Everything seems rather ancient. The buildings are all of stone - also the floors. The majority of the French wear wooden shoes. They seem to be very hospitable. I'm picking up a little French language each day. It seems a difficult language to learn. The making and transportation of wine seems to be the greatest industry among the class of people I've seen so far. I'm doing nothing now except getting on a fatigue detail occasionally. Rest of time I stay pretty close to my billet in hopes of being called out to be sent my company.

Met a Captain in a signal Corps Bat. who was formerly a Lieutenant in our Battalion. He directed me to Division signal officer who took my name and organization and said he would take it up with Chief Signal Officer in an effort to send me back to my organization but said he didn't know whether or not he could do anything. If I had my service record and description list I could be transferred into a signal corps outfit here but as it is I'll have to stay with casual outfit. I've had quite a bit of training in the states and am first class telegrapher and qualified in all of the visual signaling and I'd like to do what good I can, if any. In the Casual Company we don't do any drilling and thats why I'd like to get back in my company or else be transferred to another organization.

Am getting good meals and feel OK all the time. Only hope you are all feeling as well as I.

Intended writing Ruby and Sam before now but don't know their address. Asked you for it some time ago but of course wont know until I get my mail.

Must close and go to bed. Was on a fatigue detail all afternoon and am a little tired.

Don't write anymore until I get what mail you've already sent.

Love to all,

Martin
