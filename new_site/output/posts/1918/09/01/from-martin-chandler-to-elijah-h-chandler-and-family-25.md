Dearest Papa, Mama, and All

Haven't had any mail for long while. Last letter I received was when all of you wrote together. Have been expecting mail in every day but none so far. I expect to get a bunch when some does come in. I'm back with the infantry now working radio. Sure was gladÂ to get back. Nothing much new to write. Everything about the same. Having dandy weather. The summer certainly has passed quick. Can hardly realize it is now September. When one has lots of work the time sure flies. I dread the coming winter but this will be the last winter we'll have to put in over here. Of that, I'm sure.

I'm enclosing a letter addressed to members of the "Rainbow Division" telling of our past work. Think it is permissible to send them home.

Have done lots drilling past month and am glad its over. Sure hate to drill. Especially when its so warm.

The allies have been giving the Germs plenty to think about since the 18th of July. Only hope they don't let up on them. Believe me the old U.S.A. will sure look good to me if I ever see it again.

Well I'll have to stop for this time. All of you write as often as you can cause theres nothing I appreciate more than letters from home. Hope this finds all of you as well as it leaves me.

Lovingly,

Martin
