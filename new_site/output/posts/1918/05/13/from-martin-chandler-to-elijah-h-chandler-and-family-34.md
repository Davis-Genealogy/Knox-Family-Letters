Dearest Papa, Mama, &amp; all,

Wrote you several days ago but it came back yesterday account containing too much news. Ha. Also one sent back which I had to Ruby so now I'll have to do them over. I received 2 letters from Papa yesterday. One dated in Feb forwarded from other company and one dated in April. That makes 7 letters I've received from you all in lat 3 days. Sure was mighty glad to get them. Ruby, Grace, Lorin, and Bess all wrote dandy long letters. Very much surprised to hear of Grover's marriage. Hope they get along OK. Bess told me of Lee Maynard's marriage also. Lots of the fellows under 31 getting married since last June. Ha.

Guess I can't tell you much news. My last effort was a failure have quite a bit of time tonight so guess I'll write everybody a letter. Ruby, Grace, and Bess. Has Bess gone to Wichita yet? Ruby said she was coming. Well I finally received my service record and will get my 6 months pay this pay day. It will be $20.00 shy account of an allotment that you all didn't get and therefore due me. You remember I told you last Jan that when I changed the allotment last November it cancelled the former one and the 20.00 for Nov. wasn't sent home and on the Jan pay roll it was marked due me but wasn't on the pay role this month. Â Guess I'll get it next month. I can use the frances very nicely. Am out of Soviet articles. Are you getting the allotment regularly? Glad you got the insurance policy. I never have received any of the packages you mentioned having sent. Don't have the last idea where they are. Hope papa gets that raise to 12. That wont be so bad.

Were having dandy weather except for rain. Everybody has their garden in. We still draw rations and do our own cooking. Like it fine. Guess you all feel the effects of the war. Relative foodstuffs, etc. I see by the "Communique" from Paris that the 3rd Liberty loan was a grand success.

The YMCAs are going great work over here. Furnish all sorts of entertainment. There were two American girls sang at YMCA here last week. Sure was a sight for sore eyes. I notice they kept gazing at a shell hole in the roof and were rather startled every time on of our "berthas" sent over a kiss to the Kaiser. Ha.

Well I must close and get busy on the rest of the letters. Don't pass this one around cause I'm going to write them all one just like it. Ha.

Am feeling great and getting along OK. Don't worry about me. Will write again, soon.

Lovingly,

Martin</body></html>
