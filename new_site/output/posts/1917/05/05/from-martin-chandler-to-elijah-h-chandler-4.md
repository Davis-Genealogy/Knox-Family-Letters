Dearest Papa, Mama, and all

Received Papa's dandy letter today. Sure good to see them come so often. Hope Ralph straightens out and gives good services. I'd hate to see him get discharged. I may write JLM pretty soon and see what he can offer. Wouldn't mind coming up to Coa if could get enough work. Think I'll come anyway. If he will put me to work and then go to work in Western Union first time I get a chance. I'll let you know what he says soon as I had from him. I'm getting pretty tired of this country. Easy job but don't like the climate.

Golly prices are sure high. Darn food trusts. It's just a drought. I'll bet theres no good reason at all for such exorbitant prices. They just use the war as an excuse.

How's Knox getting along. Knox why the Dicken's don't you write once in awhile.

Hope Margaret is well by now. Glad she didn't get Diphtheria. I wrote Sam a letter other day. Guess he will be kinda surprised to get it. Don't seem possible you are having so much rain there. Been wanting a rain here for last 4 months. I can't remember when it has rained here. Everything dry as a chip. has Grace gone to Louisville yet? Gee I'd love to see Audrey.Is Lorin still selling Oliver's?

Well i don't know much to write.

Hope to see you all before many days.

Lovingly,

Martin

P.S. Just wrote J.L.M. for a job. Let you know what he says soon as I hear from him.</body></html>
