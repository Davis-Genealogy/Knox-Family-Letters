Dearest Auntie,

Have promised myself to write you a long letter soon. This is just a forewarner. Hows Uncle? and all the rest. Haven't forgotten any of them. Had a telegram from Ruby saying she got $75 per month and guess someone told you I got a raise too? We're living on EZ street at present. Â Papa and Mama went to Pittsfield last Monday.

Love to all
