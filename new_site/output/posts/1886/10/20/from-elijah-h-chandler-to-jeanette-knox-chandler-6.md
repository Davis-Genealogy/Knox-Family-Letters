Dear Nettie,

Your kind letter received just now and I will try and answer so can send it off on the eve train. It seems like its been a month since I heard from you. I looked for a letter Monday and Tuesday. If I had not got one today I intended to write any way. You may know that i was awful glad to hear from you. Thats all I have been thinking about for the last three days. I don't know what kind of an out I will make writing today. I am bothered so often I forget what I was going to say. This is payday and it's raining and everybody is at home or at the depot asking same fool questions. There is nothing going on in Pearl of any account/ There is going to be a big meeting start here and all at Old Pearl Sat week. The Methodist members are here. A man got hurt in the quarry yesterday. I don't know his name. Got his head out. No, Miss B. has not come down yet. I don't think she will come. Yes Nettie the time you mention will suit me at present at least. We can fix it all right same time in the future.  But I have some time. But am satisfied when I know the time will come. If you was at home the time would not seem so long.

If you could remember you would know the man that Anna Lakin moved. He sold trees for a living and boarded at Lakin's and stayed at the saloons most of his time. I saw the hat you sent Maggie. I think it was just as well as could be. Nettie I am gal you do believe me and I am sure I believe all you say. If I did not I would not be paying all my attention to you. More than that, I think it would be doing any one a great injustice if they didn't mean all they say, especially on as an important a subject as we have been talking about.

Well it's impossible for me to write any more today but I will write to you again tomorrow night. Would have til tonight to have written to you but want to go to church,

Please excuse haste this time. Hoping to hear from you soon.

I remain yours truly,

E.H. Chandler</body></html>
