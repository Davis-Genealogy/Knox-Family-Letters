Mr. E.H. Chandler

Dear Lige: -

You're most welcome letter received yesterday eve late. I was very glad to hear from you again and to heat of you all begin well as this leaves us all at present. Oh! I know you all had a better time there, Christmas than I did here, I think the tree must have looked awful pretty and I only wish I could have gazed upon it. Oh! I am so tired of staying here and last night after I had retired I was thinking of home and nearly made up my mind that I would write you today to say that I would start for home soon and you could write and tell me where you would meet me, but this morn I thought I would stay a while longer anyway. I would hate to leave Johnnie, and especially as he has not found anything to do, he would be so home-sick if I would go home and Willie gone to. I don't know when Johnnie does intend to go home. I have not heard him say anything about it only to wish he was there. I think Maggie's got an awful nice present, also Ma, from the tree. Yours is quite nice also. Who was so thoughtful as to put those on for you? Do you know, I received another present since I wrote you your last. Mr. Hill sent me a large breast pin and a note asking me to accept of it with his best wishes. It is real pretty I think.

I hope you and Maggie has received your presents before this and I hope your cup or saucer was not broken when it reached you. Lige please excuse this short and poorly written letter as I will have to hurry to get it in the Riverton mail now and I am going to call at the doctor's office to have him to do some thing for my face and hands. There is some kind breakout on them and I sure am uneasy about it. Hoping to hear from you soon.



I am yours,

Nettie
