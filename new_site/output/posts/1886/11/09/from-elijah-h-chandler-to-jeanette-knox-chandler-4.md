Dear Nettie,

I just received your kind letter of 6th. Just was glad to hear from you and to know you are well. I have not been well today but I feel better this eve than I did this fair morn. Haven't had much work to do today as there is only a few trains running on account of a bridge falling down last night. We are having great times now. Everybody is at court but a few lucky ones. S. O'Shea was taken today. I think this trip will about do them up as there are several indictments on all of them. I understand Shea has made a complaint against your Pa for selling whiskey on Sundays. He says also that he had played for many at Mr. Knox's. He thinks your Pa is the cause of him and Turk being pulled as Mr. Knox is on the grand jury. But he can't do anything with your Pa. It's all spite work. I just told you so you would know more about what kind of a man Shea was. They gave Martin Whalun a summons to serve on George Ottwell last night when he went in to Surk's saloon where Ottwell was. Shea knocked him down and let Ottwell get away. I don't know what they will do with Shea if he keeps on this way. They got Ottwell today. Everybody thinks this trip will about break Surk and Shea up.

I would have old you Nettie about Johnny but I didn't want you to be grieving about it when I knew it could do not good. I am sorry that its so. I think the meeting will close tonight. I think they are getting discouraged. Lizzie F. is up at Mr. Hess' again. Said Hess and Mrs. Hess was down to Pearl yesterday but Lizzie stayed to keep house while they were gone. Johnny K and Charley Ottwell went over the river last night to keep out of the way of the Sheriff.

My hat just lands up in grand style with new work inÂ it. Sunday every time I went where Maggie and Lizzie was I tip my hat at them. Lizzie said I thought I was awful smart.

Very truly yours,
