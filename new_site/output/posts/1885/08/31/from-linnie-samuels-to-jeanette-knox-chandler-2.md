Miss Nettie Knox

My Dear Friend,

I received your welcome letter some days ago and I have been over to Sidney the past few days and so I have not had any time to write since I came home.

No. - Mr. Talbot does not intent to return.

Mr. Ellis left last Tuesday, a week from today, I just came up from Hamburg as he got on.

He said to give you and your brother his kindest regards the next time I wrote.

Mrs. Jackson did not give his party as she expected for she had no help.

She was very sorry I saw he Sunday and she and Uncle sends their regards and all the Riverton boys and girls you are acquainted with. I suppose you were out to the "Poor Farm" when you were here! I was there last Saturday

My brother John that lived with us has moved to Riverton, he moved yesterday.

I saw Miss Ellie Cromwell last Thursday and gave her your regards and she sends many in return.

I am going up to Riverton this afternoon so I must close. Please give my regards to all.

From Your Friend,

Linnie Samuels</body></html>
