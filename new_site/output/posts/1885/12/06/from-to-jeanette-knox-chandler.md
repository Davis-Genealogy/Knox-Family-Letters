Miss Nettie Knox,

Dear sister and all the rest. I will attempt to answer your kind and welcome letter which I received yesterday and of course was glad to hear of you all being well as this leaves us at present with the exception of Lizzie. She seems to be getting along very slowly.

Well Nett, we got a letter from Willie yesterday and he is giving me thunder for not writing to him. He calls me Gemmie all through the piece. He said he was going to give Gemmie (that is me) thunder when he saw her.

Nett the bridge boys are gone. They went to Chicago last Friday morning on the early train but we had the best dance of the season on Thursday night before they left. The dance was for them. Well this is Monday and no one has even heard from Ella or Betts. They have never written a sentence home. Moreover, no one ever hears of them. I think it is terrible the way they are acting. Aunt Sarah is taking it quite hard. Everyone thinks them tails are so on Ella from the way she has acted. God knows where they are. Lizzie T. has left us. She got sick and could not work anymore. So, Ma and I do all the work.

Nett there was no one event in or from church with Lizzie T. She never went very many nights there is in church. More hasn't been for a week. I haven't went in school for five weeks nor I don't guess will go much more but you know that just kills me. There is quite a stink going around about Lausdon and Moll Rose getting in thick. I guess they will have was here if the directions of the school and Mrs Lausdon hears is I guess they both will be expelled from teaching school it it gets out. Nett don't dance yourself to death at that party at Riverton Friday night. We danced here till 3 o'clock and I danced every set but 2. May says if Anna thinks best for you to get a chart for you. She gets one and learns everything about dress making you can.

We have the stove we had last winter upstairs and Pa got a great large box stove for the from room downstairs. It takes in a whole wood stick without cutting it in two.

Nett you must not get in such contacts with yours anymore or it will go off the next time sure. I read the letter with John and all the folks when I got it and of course read it about yours more before I thought so. I guess he has given it to you hot and heavy about it.

Well Nett Dock Meauk has him at $40.00 suit. Both he and Mace Smith got a suit just alike and they are lovely.

Dock came down to spend Thanksgiving with Matt and he was drunk every day while down. He stayed till Sunday.

We had a big sleet last night and a little snow. It is awful slippery this morning and cold as Greenland. Nett you must be sure and make Mr. Roush and Annie come home with you. Don't you come till they are both ready to come with you.

Well Anna Coales is over to Trazrero today having her a dress made. It is grey goods. Anna won't look in here since yesterday morning. She told the biggest lie that ever was told. She was down last Sunday and she told me that Mrs. Greathouse was down to their house the other day and she (Mrs. Greathouse) said that the same tails on Ella was out on Lizzie Johnston all over Minton that everybody was talking about it and so Lizzie and I went and seen mrs. Greathouse and asked her if ever she heard such a and thing and she said she never did in her life and said if Anna did tell that it was some of her own little lies. Lizzie is going to jump onto Anna abut it if ever she gets a chance but Anna goes by here running as hard as she can, she know she has told a lie. So you see when your not here they are going to pick on Lizzie. Well I guess this is all at present. I remain your sister.

R.
