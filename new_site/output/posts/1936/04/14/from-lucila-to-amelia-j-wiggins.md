Dear Mother,

As I have time I thought I would write you a few lines. Hoping my letter will find well. I am all right. How is it down there in Ohio? You You are all having some awful floods from what I seen in papers and what I been told. So I thought I would write to see if you are still alive. I hope that you dont get in those awful floods. We are beginning to have awful hot weather. I like Arizona - that is the weather here, but in summer it gets awful hot here. I feel it here more than I did any place I lived. I sure love to go back to Calif and go to Hollywood. I know all the movie stars. When is you birthday Mother? O yes have you heard anything about my kids.

Well mother I must close for this time, as I have one more letter to write. I remember the good times we used to have together. Then I got to go to town and I mail this on my way to town. I sure love to hear from my kids.

Have you every read that letter from my daughter she write to you.

Well good mother again I say good bye with love to you till I hear from you again will writte me next time.

Your daughter
