Dear Sister and family,

I have since you were here, been making inquiry whenever I could in regard to the "Annex" to the State Hospital. These buildings are for Vocational training of patients that can be trusted or handled outside of the main building. This state and Hospital has gained world wide reputation since taking up this line of training of inmates and has recently attracted leading physicians of other state institutions there to learn the details of this work. The idea is this: to give those that can be trusted the best of environments afforded with something to keep their minds and body employed and with the training and treatment, many of them will soon recover. Dr. Chapin was here yesterday. He speaks very highly of Dr. Hill, and of being a gentleman of the highest type, but his letter to you was a mistaken identity - or he was badly off. I want to go to the Hospital and meet Dr. Hill and would like D. C. or some other physician of acquaintance to go with me.

I believe the Annex is the best for Annie, she has heard of the Annex, and formed a wrong conception of its purposes. Perhaps though after patients that did not know any more of it than she didd and had become biased against it by name, without knowing its real purpose. Mr. and Mrs. Fox, Edith &amp; Mildred drove to Pittsfield Friday, stopped at Milton for minutes. Mr. Fox has business that took him there.

Lucile is home, expect to remain for another week or possibly longer. I am expecting to go to J-Ville soon and will if I have the time to visit the Hospt, but doubt  that invite. I expect to take a patient to Dr. Morbury and other doctors for examination and may be crowded for time at the visit. What has become of John? I used to hear from him once and a while, not for a long time now.

Your Bro,

W.T. Knox</body></html>
