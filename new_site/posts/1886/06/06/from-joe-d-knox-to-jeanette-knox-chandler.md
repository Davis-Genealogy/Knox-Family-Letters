Pearl, June 6, 1886

Dear Nettie, Annie, and all the family,

I do not think I answered your last letter to me. Have been very busy for the last week. I took a great interest in the nomination of some of the candidates, for some of the various places to be felled this fall and all. I though aught to be nominated but there, of course you would not know their names if I was to tell you. You may bet I was some surprised when Willie walked up to me in the Courthouse yard yesterday and say's how do you before I even saw him or knew he was about. I left home on Sunday Eve to attend the convention to be at P. Mofela  next day. So Willie came in on Monday morning at 4:10, before any of our folks were up he went up stairs thinking w slept up there but when failed to find us, he then came down and went to get onto the lower part of the House but failed. Your ma and Maggie were sleeping together, so the men got up to examine who was at the door. Gus got up as it was his time to get up anyway and opened the door. Willie walked in, said nothing, went to the bedroom door where your Ma and Maggie was. Your Ma opened the door a little, but did not get a fair look and did not know him but Maggie peeked out still being in bed and squalled at the top of her voice oh it's Willie. Ma and Maggie had lots of excitement that day, and could not be convinced that you and Annie were somewhere secreted but, of course, composed themselves agreeably to have the pleasure of seeing Willie. He looked well and seems to have good health. You may believe he met with Warren Fosiment yesterday in Cittafield. I bet if he would have drank he could have a bit. He met all the Detroit and Florence, Feprounds, and Monteguma. I tell you they were all glad to see him. Willie said you folks were coming down in a week or two, all for the best. Of course you will be here before Willie returns.  He has been telling us lots of the news. How Luary can sing heel and toe and the boys coming in on the polka. Oh you may tell J. and the boys that this short legged boy is still training. He can jump full turn and pestle, but I think the boys will down him, because his leg is too short. Igora and Lolisa was here Saturday and went home Sunday. All Well Spemmily Smith is still working 3 miles on the Quarry at $2.25 in muscle a day. I think he is doing very well but has to stick steady and shortly to work no shuffling work must be done and attended to so far as the most work is concerned, as they have 125 men dependent on the work of the mules hauling the rock. For so far Smith is doing all right. Your Ma was poorly for 2 days last week took another bout out Cholera last week but is now all right.  We had another girl last week to help but she turned her off as soon as was ably to go into the kitchen again and that make it mostly hard on her in this very warm weather. I have no more with writing to mention . Maggie is now engaged to King her music teacher. Lefan is progressing very well. I am greatly hoping to find you all well. I will now quit.

From yours,

Joe D. Knox
