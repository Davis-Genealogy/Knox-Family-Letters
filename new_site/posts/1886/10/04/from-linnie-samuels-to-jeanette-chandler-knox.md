Miss Nettie Knox

My dear Friend,

I received your welcome letter yesterday and was very much surprised to hear that you were in Sidney and very glad too, but sorry to think I was not at home so you could visit me. I supposed you will be there when I come home Christmas and then we will have a splendid time. I returned to the Convent last Monday and I had written to you but sent it to Pearl, Illinois.

Brother John saw your brother before he left.

I am taking English, Fancy work, Music, and Singing. I was up to River on a week ago Saturday and bid the young people "Goodbye" and they were all very much surprised to hear that I was going away to stay till Christmas. I was very sorry to leave. Don't you think so?

When you see any of our set from Riverton please give them my kindest regards.

Please call on my sister-in-law Mrs. Joe Samuels while you are in Sidney. I know she will be glad to meet you.

Please give my regards to Mrs. Roush and children. I will close.

Love to you.

From Your True Friend,

Linnie Samuels</body></html>
