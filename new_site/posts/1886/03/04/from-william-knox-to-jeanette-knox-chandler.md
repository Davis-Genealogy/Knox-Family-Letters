Dear Sister,

On Tuesday evening you spoke about attending the dance at Hanburg on tomorrow evening.

It is a public thing and is hard to tell what kind of crowd will be there and it is safe to say it will not be best and I don't want you to go.

If it was to a "club" or select dance it would be different. I'm thinking there will be none of the best of society there.

Your Bro,

Will K.</body></html>
