Dear Sisiter:

Your most interesting letter received and was quite glad to hear that you are having such a "Mill" of a time. O well go it while your young for when you get old like I am you won't have such a fly time. Well Nett we have been having some awful blustery weather all this month, altho this is a nice day, for the sun is shining nicely, but yesterday it was cold and blowing and snowing all day. Well Nett times are duller here now than ever I seen them since we have been here, they put in a new Crusher, but they can't make it work and they have had to lay off about 50 men. They are only working about 60 now, and you know that makes a big difference but then they are going to put in another one right away and then things will get more lively. Well Nett you must think you have a big "Mountain" instead of a "Hill" the way you talk. O my! as I read your letter it makes me feel- feel- well you know how it makes a fellow feel. Well I'm glad sure you are having a good time for I know you are enjoying yourself and your visit. Well Nett I haven't had a white shirt button or twice since you left so you may know I am growing quite fast, all there has been no place to go to and it is to much trouble for a fellow to fix up maggie &amp; Lizzie are both under the weather, Maggie had a chill yesterday and Liz got up this morning not feeling well, but maybe it wont amount to much. Ma has been doing the work all day by herself, and she is not very stout. Mad seems to think more of 1.00 or 2.00 per week than she does of her health. Lizzie can do the work easy enough if she could only keep her health. Well Nettie, Will never said any thing about that "High elevation of land" he only hinted a little thats all. O well you needn't get your nose up at Bro Will for speaking of him, I know you want it all to say yourself about him but he never said anything bad, he only said that he got sick at College and had to come home, but he knew very quickly what was the matter with him, he thought he had heart disease, for he went to eating pickles right off. . Well pickles is a great remedy, aint they? Well yes. Will said that he was so bad off that he went straight to see you. Euymph my! well hope he is better now, Lizzie F was here yesterday eve and until bedtime. She is coming over tomorrow I think, to make Ma a dress. Well I'll tell her what you said for me to do (to kiss her for you) but then I know it will almost plague me to death to kiss a girl right before her and her looking at me too. But then I'll try it, wouldn't you? Well Nett there is an awful amount of sickness around here. The disease is mostly lung fever. Abbie Dugan is at Sinks and they don't think she can ever get well. It is to bad for that poor girl that she is pretty near always sick. But then she brought big part of this on herself. Sinks had a dance on last Friday night, and she had already been feeling bad and had the doctor to call and see here, about one hour before the dance commenced, and he told her then, that she had symptoms of Lung Fever, but she would be alright if she took care of herself. But she got up (she staying there) and danced all night and consequently this spell. Uncle Jim has gone today to attend his Bro William's funeral (Denny's father). Uncle didn't know that he had been sick until he got notice of his death. Nett we are having a great action going on here now Peter Bro. From Summer "Hill" (not your hill) is in this country on it. and Jim Wheeling, auctioneer, they got good bargains there. It is about to take Flatan's and Meusenbach's life, because they are selling here. Flatten got up a petition asking the citizens to sign it, wanting to charge the auctioneer's $10 per day for the privilege of selling but he failed to get the signers. Well Nett it has been some time since I was at a dance. I never went to Sinks last one, and I don't think with the different crowd from what he has been having that I'll go anymore. Ma says as soon as the weather gets good and folks well, she will give a dance, and then we may have a good one. O you bring that "high elevated plain" and come. I would like to see my new Kinny. Has he got as big a nose as you? if he has I pity him. Well say how do you manage to kiss him. Aint your nose awfully in the way?

Well I've about said all I know of just now, but say you must soon come home, and be sure and bring Annie with you. Now tell her she must come, and if you wait much longer it will be time to make Garden and then I know she wont come, or at least she will think she can't, for she will have so much to do (or that is what they all say). Nett, Schoustein has offered $500 for the use of our house for one year, he wants to move his family here. Pa did talk some of taking him up but I hardly think he will. I wish he would and move away from here for if such a thing should happen as the Crusher stopping he would be left. You need not write back to Pa anything concerning it for he wanted it kept still. But I'll give you the news. Stewart has about quit coming around, O yes Frazier's folks are going to move into Jim Mellon's house (that house that stands on stilts) next week. Don't they have a time moving, if Lizzie was here now I think I could tell her what you told me to do. O my won't it be nice? Well I'll tell her the first time I see her, you can tell that fellow that I said for him to kiss you once for me. Now just only once. But then I know he wont't stop at that, for I don't expect to, would you? Well I wish I was there to go to the ball, but then you and he would make me have heart disease too I'm afraid. Well I'll have to close for I have run out of paper. Well I'll now try to finish up my little little letter, well you may show this to my new Kinny, Mr. Hill, if you wish. Well say can;t you get a picture of his ad send it home for us to see him. I think you could! Well I'll close for this time hoping you are all well.

O I forgot and said something about your nose and you told me not to. Well I forgot. No more now.

Your Bro

John
