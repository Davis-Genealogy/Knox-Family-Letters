Dearest Grace and all,

has been some time since I've written so thought I'd write few lines this pm while nothing to do.

Had a pleasant voyage across the Atlantic. Was on the water Christmas and New Years.

Am in the Hospital here now with measles. Come in the 15th. Am getting along OK and feel good.

Hows Audrey getting along? My I'd love to see her as well as rest of you. It hasn't been very cold here past 10 days, but has rained considerably.

I expect to join my company in about a week.

Well I can't say very much so will close. Be sure and write soon as you can. Hope you are all feeling well.

Lovingly,

Martin
