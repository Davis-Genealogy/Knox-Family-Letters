Dear Bess -

I just started a letter but Papa called me away so don't think I can possibly finish it before train time. In case I don't be sure to bring those ties Sunday and those thin blue paper tablets too. Hope I can get that letter to you. Have so much to tell you. Will be glad when you come home. Tell all "hello" and miss G. too.

Yours Lovingly,

Grace</body></html>
