Hello Bess,

I am well. Working in a haunted station. Ghost appears at twelve o'clock every night. He is a dog. How is Pearl and all of the people there? I am as happy as a lark. Only I don't get along with the ghost very well.

Have the Red Men had a pow wow lately. Would like to celebrate just once more for luck. Heard Mr. Beal left. Who is there now? mr. Beal is a wise young man. He is from Laddonia. I suppose you know that by this time. Had an awful nice time on the way up here. Stayed in St. Paul two days and Sioux city one.</body></html>
