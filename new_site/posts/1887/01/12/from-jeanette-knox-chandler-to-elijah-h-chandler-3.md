Mr. E.H. Chandler

Dear Lize,

Your most welcome letter received and contents perused with pleasure. I suppose you will not find this letter very interesting and am at a lose to know or think of anything to write at a lll. So if you find it very dry, please excuse for this time and perhaps I can do better next time. I have been doing lots of running around the past two or three days. Last Monday I spent the day with Miss Mary Hicks and yesterday I was working on fancy work all day at the milliner shop and today will go again. So you see I am making up for when I had to stay at home. Monday while I was at Miss Hick's the Dr. came up to see how I was getting along and low and behold I was visiting. I guess he thought I was a rather pert patient. Don't you think so too? yes, I guess Willie is pretty tired of Pearl by this time but Pa said in one of his letters to me that he was going to try to get Willie to stay the balance of the winter there at home. But I fear he will not succeed for I think Willie would nearly die to stay there and have nothing to do. That was too bad about that poor man that had his legs cut off and I think it was a good thing that death did claim him as he always would have been such a bad cripple. Do you know what his name is? This is a lovely day and so pleasant. There is a splendid sleighing snow on the ground and the sleigh just more than fly. Where does Scrooge work about? I suppose Joe thinks he is competent to be Opr. Agent and all in one. Will he get a job and if so, where? I think the different R.R. Co's were very good to remember you so kindly by sending you such presents as you named in you letter. Well I would like to have seen Lizzie and Maggie when their sleigh broke down. I know I would have laughed. Has Pa got a sleigh or who's do they use. Well I must now close and go up town to my work. Good-bye with my love to you.

I am ever yours,

Nettie
