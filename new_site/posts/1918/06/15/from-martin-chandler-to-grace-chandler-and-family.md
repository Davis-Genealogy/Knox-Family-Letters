Dearest Grace Lorin &amp; Audrey

Received Grace's letter few days ago but haven't had much chance to answer until now. Was mighty glad to get it. Noted the clippings you enclosed. Guess I'll be out of luck for Audrey's picture. I sure do want it too. Don't know of anything new to write. Am getting along ok and feeling fine. Think this will be the last I'll get to write for several days. Will try and write papa &amp; mama today but in case I don't wish you'd pass this one along so they'll know I'm ok yet.

Been having dandy weather up until today and its raining pretty hard today. Has Lorin changed positions yet.

Guess you have been reading the war news and note where the Americans took part. I get both the French and German Communiques each day. The Germans don't seem to think much of america as an enemy but they're going to be rudely awakened someday. They lost pretty heavily on their last drive and what ground they gained wasn't worth what they paid for it. Don't think their attempt to blockade the american coast with submarine will amount to much. More troops are arriving here all the time.

Wonder if Wade &amp; Jess have left Camp Taylor yet? Guess they'll be over here before long.

Well I can't think of anything to write so will close. Haven't received any mail, expect your letter for past 2 weeks but am expecting some today. Write often.

Lovingly,

Martin
