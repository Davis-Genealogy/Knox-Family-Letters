Dearest Folks,

Just couple of lines while in Town. Am still in Casual Camp about 5 kilometers from here. Don't know yet what they are planning to do with us. Am enclosing Christmas and New Years cards. The Cathedral is some shot up but a very pretty building. This is a town about size of Springfield. Sure am anxious to get my mail and pay.

Today is Knox's birthday - wish I could send him something but only have couple francs. Will write you soon.

Lovingly,

Martin
