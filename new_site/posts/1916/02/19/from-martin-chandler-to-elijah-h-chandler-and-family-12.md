Dearest Folks,

Arrived there last night and went to work this am. Been all day checking the place up. Had over 1000.00 worth commisionary goods. Sure am tired tonight. Got a letter from Sam yesterday - said you were worrying cause I hadn't been writing. Having sweep weather another month with bring the summer.

Sure got a lot of work ahead of me to get straightened out. Guess I'll be OK in couple days though.

This job pays $30.00 and board. If I stay here this summer will be getting 40 by then.

Only have 30 men in this gang. I have to keep track of their meals and purchases and charge them for it. Sales amounted to 18.00 yesterday. Will get my first pay the 15th of March. Have about $12.00 coming. Sure going to try and save a little if I can. May stay with this job for quite awhile and again may not. Tell better when summer comes.

Well will close-feel awful sleepy.

Sure like to hear from all of you often.



Will write Regularly Now

Lovingly,

Martin</body></html>
