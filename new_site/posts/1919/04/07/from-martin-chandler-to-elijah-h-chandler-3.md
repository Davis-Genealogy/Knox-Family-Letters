Dearest Papa, Mama, and all

Well guess I'm stuck here until next week - there is a shipment of men going out of here Saturday for Illinois and I tried to get in with them but they said it was full up and said I'd probably get out of here next week - Golly but it makes me sore. Here it is only Wednesday and I'll probably be here until next wednesday. I heard over in germ nay that they were discharging men 24 hours after their arrival in the US. I landed here the 27th and wont be out until about the 14th of this month. I don't see why in the dickens I can't go with that bunch Saturday. This sure is a rotten camp. Don't get hardly anything to eat -I'd like to tell this Newport News bunch just what I think of them.

Don;t do a blessed thing but lay around all day in this darned camp. Lordy - I wish I was home. I get so sore every time I think about staying here another week that I'd like to cuss the whole bunch.

Write me here. Think probably it will reach me before I leave.

I haven't written Grace and Lorin since landing cause I don't know their address. Certainly hope you are all well. Guess I'll be home someday.

Lots of Love,

Martin
