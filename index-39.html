Dearest Papa, Mama, and all,
Well I'm still in Casual Camp here and from looks of things I'll be here Christmas. Just my darn luck. I wouldn't mind so much if I had my mail and pay. I'd sure love to get my mail. Don't know where we go when we leave here. I've been in Casual Camp almost two months now.
We had our first snow yesterday but didn't snow very long. Having pretty cold weather and theres no place to keep warm except in bed. Got a pretty good barn to sleep in. Lord I sure wish i was on my way.
See in the papers every day about President Wilson. He got quite a reception over here. I'd like to see Paris before I go home. May have a chance to go later on. If we go back to our outfits I don't think will start home before middle of summer.
I've been doing Company's clerical work in Casual Company. Don't have much to do. It rains everyday here. Makes it nice and muddy all the time. I wouldn't mind anything if I could only get my mail. Don't know of anything I'd rather have for Christmas than my mail.
They might possibly ship us home as Casuals in which event we would be home this winter. Hope they do. I'm anxious to find out how Ruby is - no mail since 10th of October. Suppose Margaret Lucerne and Bess will be home for Christmas. Lord It's been a long while since I spent a Christmas at home. Last Christmas I was on the Atlantic. Well I'll make up for last time when I do get back cause I'm sure going to stick around home.
Well must close for this time. Hope this finds all of you well. I'm feeling ok. Will write again soon. Think will find out when we go by Monday.
Lovingly,
Martin

Dearest Folks,
Just couple of lines while in Town. Am still in Casual Camp about 5 kilometers from here. Don't know yet what they are planning to do with us. Am enclosing Christmas and New Years cards. The Cathedral is some shot up but a very pretty building. This is a town about size of Springfield. Sure am anxious to get my mail and pay.
Today is Knox's birthday - wish I could send him something but only have couple francs. Will write you soon.
Lovingly,
Martin

<p>Dear Miss Chandler,
You will probably be very much surprised to receive this letter from me, but not having heard from your Brother for some time and he being right at the front I am quite anxious about him.
Martin, or Chan as I always called him, was always so good about writing, can't understand why I haven't heard from him.
The last letter I received from him was written the 23rd of August, so you see we are very much concerned.
So a reply from you in assurance of his safety will be greatly appreciated.
With very kindest regards to all of "Chan's" folks.
I remain very sincerely,
Esther Harrington
Atascadero, California</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Just a few lines tonight while have plenty of time. Not much news to tell. You've all read of the papers and can see that the war is just about over. I've sure been thinking a lot about home lately and I'll be glad to get back, after being gone since December 1915. I'm leaving hospital tomorrow or next day. AM feeling great. AM very anxious to get back to my organization so can get my mail. Ought to be quite a bit waiting for me. I've written the girls at Wichita since being here also Grace and Lorin a couple of times. Haven't had any very cold weather here yet but of course its hardly time for real winter yet. You have read of the terms of Armistice signed with Austria and Turkey. Rather stringent aren't they? But no more than right though. Think thats about the same conditions that will secure peace for Germany. It practically amounts to unconditional surrender and theres no way out of it for Germany but to accept. 'Twould only be to her fault to continue the war as the Allies are in a position now to completely crush her. The Americans have been doing some very hard fighting since September. I'll never forget the Argonne Woods nor any of the other fronts as far as that goes, but north of Verdin has been the American troops hardest fights and they have shown what they can do.
Would like to get home in time to get some pickled peaches, Blackberry Jam, etc. Which I know Mama has put up. I'd like to be sitting around that base burner cracking black walnuts or eating apples tonight.
Papa how goes everything on the Cra.? Suppose though I'll find out soon as I get back to the outfit and get my mail. There'll be six letters from papa to every one from somebody else. Gee-You'll soon by 64. Wish I could be there the 24th. We'd go quail hunting sure. How's Knox getting along? Suppose he will have grown so that I'll hardly know him.
Well I must close. I'll write you just as soon as I get back to the Co. Hope you are all well.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dearest Sisters,
Have been intending to write ever since I came to hospital, two weeks ago but didn't know your address but decided to write tonight and mail it care of A.V.D. I got sick while at front last month and was sent to hospital but 'twas nothing serious and I'm up and about now and feeling ok. Expect to get out in a few days. I've written rest of folks since being here. Had no opportunity to write for over a month before entering the hospital. Our division was kept pretty busy - I could write but couldn't get the letters censored, as the officers had other things to occupy their time. I received mail from home very often, prior to coming to hospital but wont get any mail now until I get back to my organization which will probably be a month after leaving here. Think I answered Bess' last letter but don't remember for sure. That was before she went to Wichita.
Well everything is coming out way and I'm in high hopes the war will end this year. Turkey has capitulated and Austria will doubtless follow suit in few days so that will leave Germany to fight it out alone and the Allie's are handing her one defeat right after another. The Americans had the hardest part of the scrap, in the drive begun in departure, owing to the nature of the ground to be taken and the determination of the Germans to hold out at all costs. It was the most vital point of their line. I'll certainly be glad when we all get home. Think I'll have lots to remember and it wont be hard to remember either. I'm going to make the folks tired of having me stick around home. It will take a regiment of infantry to drive me out. I mailed the folks our A.E.F. paper, "Stars and Stripes," today. Hope they mail it to you all. Want you to see what a dandy paper it is. If you want to know the real things that are going on in the A.E.F. from the fighting troops to the S.O.S. men, just consult the "Stars and Stripes."
Weather over here same as usual-uncertain. Rain one day and sunshine the next and sometimes rain steady for a week or so. Haven't had any real cold weather yet but it seemed pretty cold sometimes when sleeping out on ground with one blanket. I'm in a regular paradise now. A real honest to goodness bed with white sheets and a pillow. I hardly knew whether to crawl in it or under it when I first came in.
Well it's about bedtime and this finishes my stock of stationary so must close. Hope you all are getting along well in school and I'm sure you are. Hope this finds Ruby and the youngster doing well. Everybody write.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all,
Thought  I'd write a few lines this pm while I had the stationary handy. Am still in hospital so have had no mail since last writing. Wont get any until I get back to my organization. I'm feeling fine and dandy and am up all the time during the day. Will be getting out before long. Notice in paper where Turkey has capitulated and it looks as though Austria will follow suit so that will leave Germany all alone. Looks as though the war was approaching the grand finale. I'd certainly love to see it over by Christmas. You've all read of the Lt. Mitice drive. Our division started that drive and went all the way through it besides holding the line for quite a while after it was over. Can't mention anything about our work since that time. Noticed that in the paper so concluded 'twas permissible for me to mention it. The allies have been doing some tall scrapping, especially the Americans. They had the hardest piece of ground to take of any of them and they're still scrapping.
Well its about supper time so must stop and peddle the coffee. I'm on K.P. here. ha. Hope you are all we'll. Don't worry any about me.
Lovingly,
Martin

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all
Haven't written for so long that I guess you all will think I've quit writing altogether. This is first chance I've had to write for some time. Wrote you the 3rd of Oct. but had no chance to mail it. I've received lots letters from all of you since last writing. Have received two from Grace enclosing Kodaks of Audrey. They sure were dandy pictures especially the last one (the one taken when she was lying on the bed) I've been in hospital since the 18th. Am getting along OK and expect to be out soon. Got sick while at the front. Am enclosing a christmas pkg. coupon but don't suppose it will reach you in time. If it doesn't, don't worry any about sending an xmas pkg.
have certainly had a nice time during past two months. Tell you all about it when we get home. Been quite a bit of peace talk floating around lately but I'm not very sanguine. How are the girls getting along in Wichita? Guess I'd better ask them though. Sure glad Margaret and Lucerne are attending school there instead of at home. See in the paper where the Liberty Loan went over the top by 150 million. That's about what we all expected. People over there sure are keeping their end up.
Guess I wont get any more mail until I get back to the outfit. Don't know when that will be. I'm feeling pretty good now except that I'm rather weak. Heard Ruby was expecting next month. Sure hope she comes through ok.
We've een having some very rainy weather over here for past month. Nothing unusual though. How's Knox getting along with school? Who is his teacher?
This ought to get home just about Papa's birthday so dad, here's wishing you many happy returns of the day.
Am going to Answer Grace and Lorin's letter soon as I get some stationary. In fact I'll answer everybody's letters and I'll try and write you all real often while I have the chance.
The Allies have certainly been delivering some fearful wallops to the Huns. Kinda got 'em hollering for peace now.
Well must close. Hope this finds you all well. Don't worry any about me.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>

Dearest Papa, Mama, and all,
Didn't geta chance to mail my letter of 3rd so will add few more lines. Received letter from papa other day and sure glad to get it. Papa keeps them coming pretty regularly. Haven't much time to write but don't know much to write anyway. Certainly been busy past month and lots to put up with. No one kicking through, nights are very cold now and have been having lots of rainy weather. Have travelled considerably since last writing. Mostly on foot.
Sure would like to see the Germans surrender so we could come home. The allies are giving them the dickens on all sides. Heard about German's request for an armistice. Don't think they will get any satisfaction until they pull their troops in.
I've been feeling fine and dandy. Hope you all are well.
I'll answer Grace's letter at first opportunity. Don't know the girl's address in Wichita. Bess didn't mention it in her letter. I'll have to close now. Going to try and rustle something to eat. Everybody write.
Lovingly,
Martin</p>
